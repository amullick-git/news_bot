HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I'm Arjav. On this day in history, January 20th, 1985, Microsoft Windows 1.0 was released, marking a pivotal shift in personal computing. A fascinating look back at how technology reshapes our world. We're here to bring you the top headlines, market updates, and crucial analysis from sources like BBC News, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many more, giving you the complete picture of what's happening globally. Joining me, as always, is our brilliant reporter, Arohi. Arohi, a lot to unpack today, particularly concerning global politics and the economy.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. It's been a busy news cycle.

HOST: Let's dive straight into the growing international tensions, particularly involving the US and Europe. We're seeing significant developments around President Trump's push to acquire Greenland.

REPORTER: Indeed. Global markets are certainly on alert after Europe signaled it plans to suspend approval of a US trade deal. This move comes directly from renewed tensions, largely stemming from President Trump's strong push to acquire Greenland. The president has been quite vocal about his desire to "take" the territory, even explaining his reasoning in private messages with world leaders, which have now been leaked. Some Republicans are beginning to publicly echo his case, embracing his rationale for wanting to control Greenland, despite the party remaining somewhat split on the issue.

HOST: And it's not just the trade deal, is it? These demands seem to be escalating broader concerns about the transatlantic alliance.

REPORTER: Absolutely. President Trump's bellicose demands about Greenland, coupled with his participation in what he calls a "board of peace," are deepening worries among European allies regarding the fate of the trans-Atlantic alliance. In fact, the UK even had to defend its Chagos deal recently, after President Trump controversially called it "an act of great stupidity," linking it to what he terms "National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired." This all points to a President embracing a foreign policy that sharply breaks from decades of U.S. tradition, effectively dismantling the existing world order as his own version begins to take shape. Both supporters and critics agree he's upending a global system that's been in place for 80 years.

HOST: This shift in foreign policy, especially these trade tensions, must be having a ripple effect on the economy. What are we seeing there?

REPORTER: The economic impact is already quite tangible. We've seen the S&P 500 post its biggest drop in months, with market jitters spreading rapidly to Asia. This coincides directly with mounting tensions over Greenland and the ongoing tariff situation. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has confirmed that President Trump's tariffs have started to "creep" into consumer prices. For a while, sellers tried to absorb the tariff shock by buying stock ahead of time, but much of that inventory has now run out, forcing many businesses to raise prices.

HOST: So, consumers are starting to feel it directly, and the broader market is reacting negatively. Are economists seeing any long-term consequences from these policies?

REPORTER: Yes, there are significant warnings. While President Trump's policies so far might have done little to fundamentally change the overall state of the American economy in his first year, economists are increasingly warning that they will ultimately weaken the United States in the long run. We're already seeing what's being dubbed the 'sell America' trade in full swing. The U.S. dollar and Treasury prices have tumbled, while gold has spiked as global investors begin to flee U.S. assets, seeking safer havens amid the escalating uncertainty.

HOST: Beyond these major geopolitical and economic shifts, Arohi, what else is making headlines globally?

REPORTER: On the international front, we have a couple of key developments. In Venezuela, House Foreign Affairs members are calling for opposition leader María Corina Machado to govern, stressing the need for free elections in her recent bipartisan meeting with lawmakers. This comes as the C.I.A.'s new focus on Latin America is evident, with reports of a covert team providing real-time support for a military operation that involved a raid to seize President Maduro.
Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia, Malaysia has announced that ASEAN will not endorse the election planned in military-ruled Myanmar. Malaysia's foreign minister Mohamad Hasan cited grave concerns over the lack of inclusive and free participation.
And a concerning humanitarian story from the Palestinian territories: a children's football club has been ordered to remove its pitch, which Israel says was illegally built, or face demolition.

HOST: Back home, any domestic news grabbing attention?

REPORTER: Yes, a significant development in Minnesota. Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to state Democrats, expanding the Justice Department’s investigation into state leaders, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. This inquiry is reportedly tied to immigration issues.
And on a much lighter note, in sports, congratulations are in order for Indiana, who capped off a perfect football season by winning their first national title with a victory over Miami!

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive updates. Before we sign off, here's a fascinating fact for you. Did you know the world's first webcam was created in 1991 at Cambridge University to monitor the coffee pot in the Trojan Room, allowing researchers to see if the pot was full without leaving their desks? A surprising precursor to today's ubiquitous video calls! That's all for tonight's Quick News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. Have a great evening, and we'll see you back here tomorrow.
