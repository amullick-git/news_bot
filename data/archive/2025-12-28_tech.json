    "summary": "<p>I built a CLI tool that lets you do common video/audio operations without remembering ffmpeg syntax.<p>Instead of:\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf \"fps=15,scale=480:-1:flags=lanczos\" -loop 0 output.gif<p>You write:\n  ff convert video.mp4 to gif<p>More examples:\n  ff compress video.mp4 to 10mb\n  ff trim video.mp4 from 0:30 to 1:00\n  ff extract audio from video.mp4\n  ff resize video.mp4 to 720p\n  ff speed up video.mp4 by 2x\n  ff reverse video.mp4<p>There are similar tools that use LLMs (wtffmpeg, llmpeg, ai-ffmpeg-cli), but they require API keys, cost money, and have latency.<p>Ez FFmpeg is different:\n  - No AI \u2013 just regex pattern matching\n  - Instant \u2013 no API calls\n  - Free \u2013 no tokens\n  - Offline \u2013 works without internet<p>It handles ~20 common operations that cover 90% of what developers actually do with ffmpeg. For edge cases, you still need ffmpeg directly.<p>Interactive mode (just type ff) shows media files in your current folder with typeahead search.<p>npm install -g ezff</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46400251\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46400251</a></p>\n<p>Points: 375</p>\n<p># Comments: 188</p>",
