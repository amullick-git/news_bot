I wanted something native to the Python tools I already use.<p>The Solution: SnackBase is a self-hosted Python (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy) backend that includes:<p>Compliance Core: Immutable audit logs with blockchain-style hashing (prev_hash) for integrity.<p>Native Python Hooks: You can write business logic in pure Python (no webhooks or JS runtimes required).<p>Clean Architecture: Strict separation of layers. No business logic in the API routes.<p>The Stack:<p>Python 3.12 + FastAPI<p>SQLAlchemy 2.0 (Async)<p>React 19 (Admin UI)<p>Links:<p>Live Demo: <a href=\"https://demo.snackbase.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://demo.snackbase.dev</a><p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/lalitgehani/snackbase\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/lalitgehani/snackbase</a><p>The demo resets every hour.

    "summary": "<p>I\u2019ve been building and selling software since the early 2000s, starting with classic shareware. In 2011, I moved into the App Store world and built an iOS budget app because I needed a simple way to track my own expenses.<p>At the time, my plan was to replace a few larger shareware projects with several smaller apps to spread the risk. That didn\u2019t quite work out \u2014 one app, MoneyControl, quickly grew so much that it became my main focus.<p>Fifteen years later, the app is still on the App Store, still actively developed, and still used by people who started with version 1.0. Many apps from that era are long gone.<p>Looking back, these are some of the things that mattered most:<p>Starting early helped, but wasn\u2019t enough on its own.\nEarly visibility made a difference, but long-term maintenance and reliability are what kept users.<p>Focus beat diversification.\nI wanted many small apps. I ended up with one large, long-lived product. Deep focus turned out to be more sustainable.<p>Long-term maintenance is most of the work.\nAdapting to new iOS versions, migrating data safely, handling edge cases, and keeping old data usable mattered more than flashy features.<p>Discoverability keeps getting harder.\nReaching users on the App Store today is much more difficult than it was years ago. Prices are higher than in the old 99-cent days, but visibility hasn\u2019t improved.<p>I\u2019m a developer first, not a marketer.\nI work alone, with occasional help from freelancers. No employees, no growth team. The app could probably have grown more with better marketing, but that was never my strength.<p>You don\u2019t need to get rich to build something sustainable.\nI didn\u2019t build this for an exit. I\u2019ve been able to make a living from my work for over 20 years, which feels like success to me.<p>Building things you actually use keeps you honest.\nEvery product I built was something I personally needed. That authenticity mattered more than any roadmap.<p>This week I released version 10 with a new design and a major technical overhaul. It feels less like a milestone and more like preparing the app for the next phase.<p>Happy to answer questions about long-term app maintenance, indie development, or keeping a product alive across many iOS generations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46599341\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46599341</a></p>\n<p>Points: 61</p>\n<p># Comments: 38</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Hey HN! We\u2019re Will and Jorge, and we\u2019ve built LAD (Language-Aided Design), a SolidWorks add-in that uses LLMs to create sketches, features, assemblies, and macros from conversational inputs (<a href=\"https://www.trylad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.trylad.com/</a>).<p>We come from software engineering backgrounds where tools like Claude Code and Cursor have come to dominate, but when poking around CAD systems a few months back we realized there's no way to go from a text prompt input to a modeling output in any of the major CAD systems. In our testing, the LLMs aren't as good at making 3D objects as they are are writing code, but we think they'll get a lot better in the upcoming months and years.<p>To bridge this gap, we've created LAD, an add-in in SolidWorks to turn conversational input and uploaded documents/images into parts, assemblies, and macros. It includes:<p>- Dozens of tools the LLM can call to create sketches, features, and other objects in parts.<p>- Assembly tools the LLM can call to turn parts into assemblies.<p>- File system tools the LLM can use to create, save, search, and read SolidWorks files and documentation.<p>- Macro writing/running tools plus a SolidWorks API documentation search so the LLM can use macros.<p>- Automatic screenshots and feature tree parsing to provide the LLM context on the current state.<p>- Checkpointing to roll back unwanted edits and permissioning to determine which commands wait for user permission.<p>You can try LAD at <a href=\"https://www.trylad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.trylad.com/</a> and let us know what features would make it more useful for your work. To be honest, the LLMs aren't great at CAD right now, but we're mostly curious to hear if people would want and use this if it worked well.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100</a></p>\n<p>Points: 175</p>\n<p># Comments: 95</p>",
