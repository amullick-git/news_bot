Box was a US Forest Ranger in Northern California, and I've got his daily work diary from 1927-1945, through the depression, WWII, Conservation Corps, and lots of forest fires. I've scanned the entire thing, had Claude help with transcription, indexing, and web site building, and put the whole thing here:<p><a href=\"https://forestrydiary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forestrydiary.com/</a><p>This is one of those projects I've sat on for years, but with Claude and Mistral helping with the handwriting recognition, and even helping me write a custom scanning app that would auto scan each page and put it into a database as I assembled everything.<p>As far as I know, this is the only US Forestry Diary that has been fully scanned in and published. I understand that there are other diaries in some collections, but none have been scanned in. I hope this helps somebody. Please let me know if it does.<p>This is the sort of project Claude and AI can help with - A personal project that sits on the shelf forever, but now a reasonable project that can be published in my spare time.

It is browser based camera toy where you \"rewire\" CCD pin pairs, turn knobs to get different glitch artefacts in real time to capture as photos. I had fun learning to simulate different pin modes - channel split, hue/phase shifts, horizontal clock delays, colour kill etc.<p>Here are some photos taken: <a href=\"https://glitchycam.com/gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://glitchycam.com/gallery</a><p>I intentionally leaned towards skeuomorphic design for nostalgia. I miss the days where I'd spend hours making a button to look like a physical button. Here I chose to make it look like a \"good enough\" Teenage Engineering device UI.<p>I tested/used GPT-5.3-Codex to build this from scratch, since there was a lot of hype around it on X. Maybe I wasn\u2019t using it right, but I found it needed a lot of code cleanup at every step and a lot of hand holding along the way. It missed details/nuances and didn't land the skeuomorphic buttons or the interaction polish. It mostly helped with boilerplate where there wasn't much thinking/detailing. It did give a basic starting point for the effect calculations, but didn't really move the needle on the details.<p>Please give it a go and let me know what you think - your photos and video never leave your browser (you can download them if you choose to).

    "summary": "<p>Hi HN,\nAfter roughly 8 years of silently rolling 1.1 nightlies, we finally tagged a proper stable 2.0 release.\nWe built this because wrist-sized Linux is genuinely fun to hack on, and because a handful of us think it's worth keeping capable hardware alive long after manufacturers move on. Smartwatches don't really get old \u2014 the silicon is basically the same as it was a decade ago. We just keep making it useful for us.<p>No usage stats, no tracking, no illusions of mass adoption. The only real signal we get is the occasional person who appears in our Matrix chat going \"hey, it booted on my watch from 2014 and now it's usable again\" \u2014 and that's plenty.<p>Privacy is non-negotiable: zero telemetry, no cloud, full local control. Longevity is the other half: we refuse to let good hardware become e-waste just because support ended.\nOn the learning side, it's been one of the best playgrounds: instant feedback on your wrist makes QML/Qt, JavaScript watchfaces and embedded Linux feel tangible. The community is small and kind \u2014 perfect for people who want to learn open-source dev without gatekeeping.<p>Technically we're still pragmatic: libhybris + older kernels on most devices since it just works, but we've already mainlined rinato (Samsung Gear 2) and sparrow (ASUS ZenWatch 2) \u2014 rinato even boots with a usable UI. That's the direction we're pushing toward.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/AsteroidOS</a> \nInstall images & docs: <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://asteroidos.org</a> \n2.0 demo video : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc</a> \nAnnouncement post: <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/</a><p>Questions, port requests, mentoring offers, criticism, weird ideas \u2014 all welcome.

    "summary": "<p>Throughout my career, I tried many tools to query PostgreSQL, and in the end, concluded that for what I do, the simplest is almost always the best: raw SQL queries.<p>Until now, I typed the results manually and relied on tests to catch problems. While this is OK in e.g., GoLang, it is quite annoying in TypeScript. First, because of the more powerful type system (it's easier to guess that updated_at is a date than it is to guess whether it's nullable or not), second, because of idiosyncrasies (INT4s are deserialised as JS numbers, but INT8s are deserialised as strings).<p>So I wrote pg-typesafe, with the goal of it being the less burdensome: you call queries exactly the same way as you would call node-pg, and they are fully typed.<p>It's very new, but I'm already using it in a large-ish project, where it found several bugs and footguns, and also allowed me to remove many manual type definitions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47050872\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47050872</a></p>\n<p>Points: 52</p>\n<p># Comments: 21</p>",

    "title": "Thank HN: You helped save 33k lives",
    "summary": "<p>13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].<p>For nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn\u2019t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.<p>I was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24/7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don\u2019t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.<p>Over the years we learned that product/market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, \"I'd love to donate to a nonprofit today\" with the same oomph that they think, \"I'd love a coffee\" or \"I'd like to make more money.\"<p>No matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.<p>I made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi's success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.<p>This was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.<p>Now that I have perspective, I'm incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.<p>In a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here's a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it's not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity.
