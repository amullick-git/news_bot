HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your essential start to the day, bringing you the latest headlines and in-depth analysis from around the globe. I'm Arjav, and joining me today is our esteemed reporter, Arohi, to break down the stories that matter most.

REPORTER: Good morning, Arjav! Always a pleasure to be here, ready to dive into today’s impactful news.

HOST: Absolutely. Before we jump into the top stories, let's take a quick look at history. On this day, February 19th, in 1878, American inventor Thomas Edison was granted a patent for his phonograph, a device capable of recording and reproducing sound. A truly groundbreaking moment in the history of technology and communication, setting the stage for so much of what we experience today.

HOST: Today, we're covering a wide array of news from BBC News, NPR Topics, US Top News and Analysis, and several other trusted sources. We have a packed agenda, with major developments in international politics, the US economy, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, and a quick check-in on the world of international cricket. Arohi, let's start with some significant international headlines, one involving the British Royal Family and another concerning US diplomacy. What's the latest?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. We have some significant news from the United Kingdom this morning. U.K. police have reportedly arrested Former Prince Andrew on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Details are still emerging, but U.K. media outlets confirm this development. This certainly marks a pivotal moment for the Royal Family, adding another layer to already ongoing scrutiny.

REPORTER: Simultaneously, on the diplomatic front, President Trump is hosting the first-ever Board of Peace meeting today. This initiative aims to bring together various stakeholders to discuss global peace efforts. We understand the initial session is focused on establishing a framework for future discussions and identifying key areas where the board can contribute to de-escalation and conflict resolution, especially in light of ongoing international tensions. The White House has emphasized that this is a long-term commitment, designed to foster dialogue and find common ground on complex geopolitical issues. The formation of this board has been a topic of much discussion in recent weeks, and today marks its official debut on the international stage.

HOST: That's certainly a lot to take in, Arohi. An arrest involving the Royal Family is always major news, and the President's Board of Peace meeting could have significant implications for global diplomacy. Now, shifting our focus to another critical international situation, the United States has been increasing its military presence near Iran. Can you give us the details on what's happening in that region?

REPORTER: Certainly, Arjav. The situation in the Middle East, particularly concerning Iran, remains highly dynamic. While President Trump has not yet authorized direct military action, the United States has undeniably ramped up its presence in the region over recent weeks, and is now sending even more firepower. This includes, crucially, bringing another aircraft carrier closer to the Mideast. This increased deployment is a clear signal amidst escalating tensions.

REPORTER: Reports indicate that President Trump has discussed various attack options with his advisers, with some speculation that a strike could occur as early as this weekend. This is happening concurrently with Iran and the United States engaging in what is being described as "gunboat diplomacy." Just yesterday, Tehran held joint military drills with Russia in the region, a move seen as a direct counter-response to the American military buildup. These actions are unfolding as crucial nuclear talks hang in the balance, creating a very delicate and potentially volatile situation where both sides are signaling strength while attempting to influence negotiations. The White House is actively pressing Iran to make a deal, but this pressure is coupled with a significant and visible show of military force. The intricate dance between diplomacy and military posturing is at an all-time high, with the international community watching very closely for any developments that could alter the regional security landscape.

HOST: It sounds like a very precarious situation, Arohi, with both sides clearly demonstrating their capabilities. Now, staying on the topic of President Trump and international relations, we're seeing some interesting developments regarding the Chagos Islands and Diego Garcia. What's the latest twist there?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav, it's a perplexing turn of events. President Trump has issued a directive to the UK, stating, "Do not give away Diego Garcia." This comment comes just a day after the United States had officially given its backing to the UK's Chagos deal. This sudden public statement by the President creates a significant diplomatic quandary for the UK and raises questions about the consistency of US foreign policy on this matter.

REPORTER: For context, the Chagos Archipelago, where Diego Garcia is located, has been a long-standing point of contention. Diego Garcia itself is strategically vital, hosting a crucial US military base. The recent Chagos deal involved discussions about the sovereignty and future of the islands, and the US had seemingly aligned with the UK's position. The President's direct instruction, delivered so quickly after his administration's official backing, introduces an unexpected challenge and underscores the complexity and often unpredictable nature of international agreements under this administration. It's a clear instance where public presidential statements can immediately impact diplomatic understandings, leaving allies to navigate a suddenly shifted landscape.

HOST: That certainly complicates things for our allies. Moving from international diplomacy to the domestic economic front, let's talk about trade. We've seen new data regarding the U.S. trade deficit for 2025. What do those numbers tell us about the impact of President Trump's tariffs?

REPORTER: The latest data from the Census Bureau for 2025, Arjav, shows some interesting and somewhat mixed results regarding the US trade deficit, especially when considering the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The overall trade deficit with the world actually narrowed. This improvement was largely driven by an expanding trade surplus in services, indicating a strong performance in areas like technology, finance, and other intangible goods where the US has a competitive edge.

REPORTER: However, beneath that overall figure, the picture for goods trade is quite different. The trade deficit in goods was the highest on record in 2025. This means that while the US is exporting more services, it's importing a significantly larger volume and value of physical goods than it's exporting. Despite the administration's stated goal of reducing the trade deficit through tariffs, the imbalance for goods persisted and even worsened to a record high. The total U.S. trade deficit for 2025 totaled $901 billion. What this suggests is that while tariffs may have reshuffled global trade flows, they haven't fundamentally altered the overall pattern of goods consumption and production to significantly narrow the goods deficit. The data released Thursday showed the deficit swelled in December, closing out a year in which the imbalance was essentially unchanged from the previous year, despite the aggressive tariff policies. This highlights the complex interplay of global supply chains, consumer demand, and international trade dynamics that make reversing these trends a significant challenge.

HOST: Those figures certainly present a nuanced view of the economy. On the domestic political front, President Trump has also been very vocal about election integrity. Arohi, what can you tell us about his latest push for a national voter ID mandate?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. President Trump is actively fanning the flames of election access, making a strong push for a national voter ID requirement across the United States. His stated goal is to impose this mandate via executive order, which would bypass the often-lengthy legislative process in Congress. This initiative is gaining considerable traction and growing support among Republican lawmakers and voters who argue that a national ID requirement is essential for ensuring the integrity and security of elections.

REPORTER: Proponents of a national voter ID mandate believe it would prevent voter fraud and increase public confidence in election results. They argue that requiring photo identification at polling places is a common-sense measure, similar to presenting ID for other everyday activities like boarding an airplane or purchasing alcohol. However, critics often raise concerns that such a mandate, particularly if implemented nationwide, could disproportionately disenfranchise certain segments of the population, including the elderly, low-income individuals, students, and minority groups who may face challenges in obtaining required identification. They worry about the potential for administrative hurdles and the costs associated with acquiring new forms of ID, which could act as barriers to voting. This debate over voter ID continues to be a highly contentious issue in American politics, with strong arguments from both sides regarding accessibility versus security. The President's move to potentially implement this through executive action indicates a clear desire for swift and decisive change on this front.

HOST: That's a debate that will undoubtedly continue to generate significant discussion. Now, we're going to pivot to a different kind of story, a missing persons case that has garnered national attention. Arohi, what's the latest in the search for Nancy Guthrie?

REPORTER: This is a truly concerning situation, Arjav. The desperate hunt for a breakthrough in the case of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie has now entered its third week, and the search efforts have expanded significantly, turning their focus towards Mexico. Nancy Guthrie, for those unfamiliar, is the mother of prominent US presenter Savannah Guthrie.

REPORTER: The initial search was concentrated in areas near her last known whereabouts, but with no significant leads emerging after an extended period, investigators have broadened their scope. The decision to extend the search into Mexico suggests that authorities are exploring all possible avenues, perhaps based on potential travel patterns, witness reports, or even simply exhausting all domestic possibilities. This is a very difficult time for the Guthrie family, and the extensive efforts by law enforcement reflect the urgency and seriousness of finding any information regarding her whereabouts. Every resource is being deployed in hopes of bringing her home safely.

HOST: Our thoughts are certainly with the Guthrie family during this incredibly difficult time. Now, let's shift gears completely and talk about the burgeoning world of artificial intelligence. We've seen a lot of news this week around AI, particularly involving big tech and international developments. Arohi, Meta is making a significant move in the election landscape related to AI. Can you elaborate?

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is making a substantial investment in the upcoming election cycle, dedicating $65 million to advance its AI agenda. This isn't primarily about endorsing specific candidates, but rather about influencing the legislative environment. Meta's biggest election investment aims to prevent state legislation that it fears could inhibit artificial intelligence development. The company believes that a fragmented regulatory landscape, with varying state-level restrictions, could stifle innovation and hinder the US from staying competitive in the global AI race.

REPORTER: Their spending is commencing this week in key states like Texas and Illinois, where legislative debates around AI governance are expected to be prominent. This proactive approach by Meta underscores the growing importance of artificial intelligence to major tech companies and their willingness to engage politically to shape its future development. They're clearly looking to ensure a favorable regulatory climate for their continued investment and expansion in AI technologies, framing it as crucial for economic growth and technological leadership.

HOST: That's a significant play by Meta, signaling just how critical the regulatory environment is for AI. And speaking of AI, there's been a major AI Impact Summit in India, drawing global attention. Arohi, what were the key takeaways from this summit, particularly India's vision for AI?

REPORTER: The India AI Impact Summit, held in New Delhi and inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has indeed been a focal point for global AI discussions, Arjav. India is positioning itself as a major player and is likely to push a "Democratised AI" doctrine following the summit. This concept emphasizes making AI accessible and beneficial to all, not just a select few or powerful corporations. India envisions AI sitting at the core of how a nation governs, heals, teaches, feeds, and delivers justice to its citizens. This is a far-reaching vision, integrating AI into the very fabric of national infrastructure and public services.

REPORTER: A key demand from India at this summit has been the need for independent AI models with a "kill switch." This is a crucial aspect of their sovereignty push. The idea is that India needs to develop its own AI capabilities and models, rather than relying solely on borrowed AI from other nations. The "kill switch" concept is about retaining full control, ensuring that the nation can disable or control these AI systems in times of national security concerns or emergencies, preventing external interference or malicious use. This emphasis on indigenous, controlled AI reflects a broader geopolitical strategy to ensure technological self-reliance and national security in the age of advanced computing.

HOST: That's a very clear and ambitious vision from India, particularly the emphasis on independent models and the "kill switch." What other major voices and developments emerged from the summit?

REPORTER: The summit brought together a powerful convergence of global and domestic leaders, Arjav. Prime Minister Modi not only inaugurated the event but convened foreign leaders, the richest Silicon Valley companies, and thousands of Indian entrepreneurs for a week of intense deal-making. This signifies India's strategic intent to search for its prominent place in global AI, attracting investment and fostering collaboration. The economic impact and potential for technological partnerships were central to the discussions.

REPORTER: Jeet Adani, a prominent figure in Indian business, also spoke, stating that AI will redefine sovereignty. He emphasized the critical role of "compute and cloud sovereignty," explaining that if energy is the fuel for a nation's growth, then compute power is the factory. His point underscores the idea that control over data centers, computing infrastructure, and the ability to process vast amounts of information locally is just as vital as energy independence for national autonomy in the digital age. This ties directly into India's call for independent AI models.

REPORTER: Furthermore, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, was a key speaker and made a significant statement, calling for AI regulation to be implemented "urgently." His remarks, coming from the head of one of the world's leading AI development companies, highlight the industry's own recognition of the potential risks and ethical challenges posed by advanced computing power. This AI Impact Summit is the fourth annual gathering of its kind, serving as a vital platform for stakeholders to discuss how to responsibly handle and govern advanced computing power, bringing together policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers to chart a path forward. The urgency expressed by Altman reflects a growing consensus within the tech community that governance frameworks are essential to harness AI's benefits while mitigating its dangers.

HOST: It's fascinating to hear leaders from the heart of AI development advocating for urgent regulation. And Arohi, it sounds like even with these global discussions, there's still intense competition within the AI industry itself. Any details on that?

REPORTER: You've hit on a crucial point, Arjav. The competition among AI giants was subtly yet notably on display at the India summit. There was an interesting and somewhat awkward moment involving Sam Altman of OpenAI and Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic. These are two of the leading and most competitive AI companies globally. During a photo opportunity or a public appearance, the two CEOs reportedly opted not to link hands, a small gesture but one that was quickly picked up by observers.

REPORTER: This seemingly minor interaction is quite symbolic. It highlights the intense rivalry that exists between these companies as they race to develop and deploy the most advanced AI models. While they may share common ground on the need for regulation and responsible development, the underlying competition for market share, talent, and technological leadership is incredibly fierce. Each company is striving to be at the forefront of AI innovation, and that drive often manifests in a cautious, competitive stance even in public forums. It's a reminder that beneath the collaborative discussions about AI's future, the business of AI is as competitive as any other frontier technology.

HOST: That’s a great insight into the dynamics of the AI industry, Arohi. From cutting-edge technology to the competitive world of sports, let's turn our attention to international cricket. We had a T20 World Cup match that delivered quite a surprise. What happened?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav, the T20 World Cup provided an unexpected upset that has certainly energized the tournament. We saw Sri Lanka face off against Zimbabwe. Both teams had already secured their spots in the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup, meaning this particular match was more about momentum and final group standings, rather than qualification.

REPORTER: Sri Lanka opted to bat first in the match, choosing to set a target. They played Madushanka and Madushan, bringing in some strategic changes. However, it was Zimbabwe who truly stunned Sri Lanka. The Zimbabwean bowlers put in a disciplined performance, keeping Sri Lanka to a total of 178 runs on what was described as a sluggish track, making batting somewhat challenging. But the real showstopper came from Zimbabwe's batters. They combined effectively, chasing down the target and sealing what became their second-highest successful T20 International chase. This victory not only secured them a win against a strong opponent but also allowed Zimbabwe to enter the Super Eight stage unbeaten, a remarkable achievement that solidifies their position as a formidable contender in the tournament. It was a thrilling display of skill and determination from Zimbabwe, proving that on any given day, any team can rise to the occasion.

HOST: What an exciting outcome for Zimbabwe, carrying incredible momentum into the Super Eight! Arohi, thank you so much for breaking down all of today's top stories. It's been a truly comprehensive look at the news shaping our world.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav. Always great to be here.

HOST: And before we sign off, here’s a fun fact for you: The internet's first-ever webcam was created in 1991 at the University of Cambridge. Its sole purpose was to monitor a coffee pot in the Trojan Room, allowing researchers to see if the coffee was ready without leaving their desks. A simple start for a technology that would soon connect the world!

HOST: That's all for today's News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. We'll be back tomorrow with more essential news and analysis. Until then, have a fantastic day!
