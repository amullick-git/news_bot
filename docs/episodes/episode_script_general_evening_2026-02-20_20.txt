HOST: Good Evening! Welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m Arjav, and joining me today with the latest headlines is Arohi.

REPORTER: Good evening, Arjav. It's great to be here.

HOST: Arohi, before we dive into today's top stories, let's take a moment to reflect on an interesting point in history. On this day, February 20th, 1962, John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth, marking a monumental achievement in space exploration and human ingenuity. It was a day that truly propelled us into a new era of technology and discovery. From that historical leap forward, we now bring you the most significant developments from around the globe. Today, we're covering critical updates from sources like NDTV News, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many others. Let's start with some fascinating cultural news from India, Arohi. What can you tell us about a new exhibition in Delhi?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. A new exhibition in Delhi is shedding light on a captivating aspect of India's colonial past. Titled 'The Camera as Witness,' it showcases 200 rare photographs that reveal how photography was utilized by the British empire to classify and define identities across India. The exhibition explores how these images, often meticulously cataloged, played a role in the colonial administration's efforts to understand, categorize, and ultimately control the diverse population of the subcontinent. It’s a powerful look at the intersection of art, history, and power.

HOST: That sounds like a profoundly insightful exhibition, highlighting the often-overlooked power of visual representation in history. Moving from cultural history to contemporary politics, what's the latest from Rahul Gandhi regarding recent incidents in Kashmir?

REPORTER: On the political front, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has strongly condemned recent attacks on Kashmiris. He stated unequivocally that "forces of hate" are behind these incidents and affirmed his party's commitment to fighting against such divisive ideologies. His remarks underscore the ongoing tensions and the political response to ensuring harmony and security in the region.

HOST: An important statement from the Congress leader. Now, shifting gears to infrastructure and progress, there's exciting news about India's transportation network. What's the latest on the new metro system planned for Meerut?

REPORTER: India is set to introduce its fastest metro system in Meerut. This new metro will operate at an impressive speed of 120 kilometers per hour, featuring three coaches, and will include all scheduled stoppages along its route. This development marks a significant upgrade in urban transit for the region, promising faster and more efficient travel for commuters. It's a clear indicator of India's rapid advancements in modern infrastructure.

HOST: That's a remarkable development for urban connectivity and a testament to India's focus on modernizing its public transport. Now, let's turn our attention to a major international story that has significant implications for global trade and economics: the US Supreme Court's recent ruling on tariffs imposed by President Trump. Arohi, can you break down this complex situation for us?

REPORTER: Certainly, Arjav. This is a monumental decision. The US Supreme Court delivered a significant blow to President Trump's economic policy, ruling 6-3 to strike down his "reciprocal" tariffs. This decision deems large parts of these tariffs unconstitutional, essentially overturning a key component of his trade strategy that had impacted global markets.

HOST: So, with such a major ruling against his tariff policy, what has President Trump's reaction been? And how does this affect existing trade relations, especially with countries like India?

REPORTER: President Trump's immediate response was defiant. He asserted that "nothing changes" regarding trade deals, stressing that his bond with Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains "great." However, despite the Supreme Court's rejection of his sweeping import taxes, he swiftly announced a new, broader 10% global tariff. The White House has clarified that, following this new policy and the Supreme Court's verdict, US trading partners, including India, that had reached tariff deals will now face a standardized 10% duty, irrespective of any higher rates they might have previously agreed upon. For India, this represents a tariff cut in certain areas.

HOST: That's a crucial detail for India and other trading partners. What does this ruling and the subsequent policy shift mean for various industries, particularly those that were heavily impacted by the original tariffs?

REPORTER: The retail industry, for one, is generally calling the tariff reversal a win, particularly for imports like clothing and footwear that had faced steep rates. However, the situation remains murky, as some sector-specific tariffs still persist. Small furniture retailers, for instance, are voicing concern that higher import costs could pose an existential threat. They were already grappling with high interest rates and a sluggish housing market, so this latest blow, even with the new 10% tariff, continues to present significant challenges.

HOST: And what about the consumer? Will we see an immediate impact on prices in stores?

REPORTER: For consumers, the impact on prices won't be instantaneous. While some companies may decide to temper price increases, the effect will likely take time to materialize in the market. It's a waiting game for now, as businesses adjust to the new trade landscape.

HOST: So, while the Supreme Court ruling struck down a significant part of President Trump's previous tariff policy, the new 10% global tariff suggests that we're not necessarily returning to pre-Trump trade norms. What are the broader implications for the global trade order moving forward?

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. The Supreme Court's decision, followed by the immediate introduction of new tariffs, injects considerable uncertainty into global trade. While trading partners are cheering the reversal of the "reciprocal" tariffs, businesses must still navigate what many are calling "murky waters." Experts suggest that anyone expecting a swift return to pre-Trump business as usual might be mistaken, as the landscape continues to evolve. There are also questions emerging about whether businesses and consumers can get refunds for tariffs previously deemed unlawful, adding another layer of complexity to this ongoing saga.

HOST: A truly dynamic and evolving situation, Arohi, with wide-ranging implications. Thank you for that comprehensive overview. It's clear that the global economic stage remains a place of constant change and adaptation.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And that brings us to the end of today's Quick News Briefing. Before we go, here's a unique fact for our listeners: Did you know the world's oldest continually operating company is Kongo Gumi, a Japanese construction company? It was founded in 578 AD and specialized in building Buddhist temples, operating independently for over 1,400 years before becoming a subsidiary in 2006. An incredible testament to longevity in business.

That’s all for today. Thank you for tuning in. From all of us here, have a good evening.
