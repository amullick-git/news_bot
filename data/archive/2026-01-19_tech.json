    "summary": "<p>Quick background: I used to code. Studied it in school, wrote some projects, but eventually convinced myself I wasn't cut out for it. Too slow, too many bugs, imposter syndrome \u2014 the usual story. So I pivoted, ended up as an investment associate at an early-stage angel fund, and haven't written real code in years.<p>Fast forward to now. I'm a Buffett nerd \u2014 big believer in compound interest as a mental model for life. I run compound interest calculations constantly. Not because I need to, but because watching numbers grow over 30-40 years keeps me patient when markets get wild. It's basically meditation for long-term investors.<p>The problem? Every compound interest calculator online is terrible. Ugly interfaces, ads covering half the screen, can't customize compounding frequency properly, no year-by-year breakdowns. I've tried so many. They all suck.<p>When vibe coding started blowing up, something clicked. Maybe I could actually build the calculators I wanted? I don't have to be a \"real developer\" anymore \u2014 I just need to describe what I want clearly.<p>So I tried it.<p>Two weeks and ~$100\uff08Opus 4.5 thinking model\uff09 in API costs later: I somehow have 60+ calculators. Started with compound interest, naturally. Then thought \"well, while I'm here...\" and added mortgage, loan amortization, savings goals, retirement projections. Then it spiraled \u2014 BMI calculator, timezone converter, regex tester. Oops.<p>The AI (I'm using Claude via Windsurf) handled the grunt work beautifully. I'd describe exactly what I wanted \u2014 \"compound interest calculator with monthly/quarterly/yearly options, year-by-year breakdown table, recurring contribution support\" \u2014 and it delivered. With validation, nice components, even tests.<p>What I realized: my years away from coding weren't wasted. I still understood architecture, I still knew what good UX looked like, I still had domain expertise (financial math). I just couldn't type it all out efficiently. AI filled that gap perfectly.<p>Vibe coding didn't make me a 10x engineer. But it gave me permission to build again. Ideas I've had for years suddenly feel achievable. That's honestly the bigger win for me.<p>Stack: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, four languages (EN/DE/FR/JA). The AI picked most of this when I said \"modern and clean.\"<p>Site's live at <a href=\"https://calquio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://calquio.com</a> . The compound interest calculator is still my favorite page \u2014 finally exactly what I wanted.<p>Curious if others have similar stories.
