HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I'm Arjav. On this day in history, January 28th, in 1915, the United States Coast Guard was officially created by an act of Congress, merging the Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life-Saving Service. A pivotal moment for maritime security and law enforcement, a fitting historical note as we cover today's top stories from NDTV News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, and many other trusted sources. Let's dive right into the heart of the news with Arohi, who has our lead stories.

REPORTER: Thank you. Our lead story today comes from Minnesota, where the fatal shooting of nurse Alex Pretti by border agents has ignited significant national debate and widespread protests. The agents involved in Pretti's killing over the weekend have been placed on leave, as the country grapples with the immediate aftermath and broader implications. This incident has intensified calls from Minnesota officials and local communities for President Trump to scale back or end his immigration operations in the state. We're also seeing this situation escalate amidst a very public social media dispute between President Trump and the Minneapolis Mayor over the enforcement of immigration law. This tragic event further fuels the existing tensions across the country, where contentious immigration policies and their enforcement are sparking widespread demonstrations, particularly against ICE operations. It underscores a sense of America at a boiling point, manifesting not just in protests but also in incidents like the recent attack at a town hall in Minneapolis, amid a surge of threats against lawmakers such as Representative Ilhan Omar. It’s a concerning sign of the fraying of the nation’s political fabric.

HOST: A truly volatile situation unfolding there. And speaking of law enforcement actions, we're seeing another significant development, this time from Georgia. What can you tell us about the FBI's activity there?

REPORTER: Moving to domestic politics, the FBI conducted a search at the Fulton County election office in Georgia today. While the agency has not explicitly stated if this action is directly tied to the 2020 election, it comes after the Department of Justice announced last month that it is suing Fulton County for various records related to that contentious election. This development highlights the ongoing scrutiny into electoral processes and their integrity.

HOST: From the political sphere to the economic. Let's turn our attention to the corporate world, where we're hearing about major restructuring at two tech giants. First, Amazon.

REPORTER: Turning now to the corporate world, where major restructuring is underway at two tech giants. Amazon has announced a significant global workforce reduction, cutting 16,000 jobs. This latest round of layoffs is part of the e-commerce titan's broader strategy to manage costs effectively, even as it pours substantial resources into building vast data centers. This dual approach underscores their aggressive push to compete and dominate in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.

HOST: A clear strategic shift for Amazon. And Tesla also has some big news regarding its production strategy and their bottom line.

REPORTER: Indeed. Tesla has announced it is ending production of its higher-end Model S and Model X vehicles. This decision follows a challenging financial period, with reports indicating the company's profits slumped by 46% last year, and it lost its position as the top EV seller. Significantly, the production space previously allocated for the Model S and X will now be repurposed for manufacturing humanoid robots, signaling a major strategic pivot towards advanced AI and robotics for the company's future.

HOST: Fascinating to see how these tech giants are adapting their blueprints. Now, moving from global corporations to local economies, New York City is facing a substantial budget challenge.

REPORTER: New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has stated that the only viable path to close a more than $12 billion budget gap is through raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations. He attributed the city's current financial predicament to what he characterized as a 'poisoned' budget inherited from previous administrations and political rivals.

HOST: Those are stark figures for New York. And it leads us to a broader national discussion about economic well-being: the concept of 'affordability' in America.

REPORTER: And those local economic pressures tie into a broader national conversation. A recent poll has offered insight into what Americans truly mean by 'affordability,' revealing that dissatisfaction is primarily driven by a few key necessities, especially among younger generations. High housing prices are a predominant concern. This broader dialogue around economic opportunity also includes discussions on how to 'Bring Back the American Dream,' with some analyses suggesting that empowering struggling children to escape poverty could be effectively achieved with guidance from other children and their families, fostering community-based solutions.

HOST: These are crucial conversations about the future of our society. Now, let's shift our focus to international relations and trade.

REPORTER: Shifting our focus to international relations and global trade, President Trump's administration's tariffs and persistent rhetoric are having a tangible impact on long-standing alliances. Reports indicate that longtime U.S. allies are actively diversifying their trade ties away from the United States, with many now seeking new deals and stronger partnerships with Asian superpowers, specifically China and India, in response to these ongoing tariff threats and trade uncertainties.

HOST: An interesting shift in global alliances. And finally, a brief update from India.

REPORTER: And finally, a brief update from India, where the Delhi Police Marching Contingent has secured the top position in the Judges' Choice Category at the Republic Day Parade 2026, proudly earning them the 'Best Marching Contingent' Award for their exemplary display.

HOST: A moment of notable achievement there. Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive and engaging updates on today's pressing news. And before we sign off, here's a fun fact for your day. Did you know the very word 'robot' itself actually originates from a 1920 Czech play titled 'R.U.R.' by Karel Čapek? It's derived from 'robota,' a Czech word meaning 'forced labor' or 'drudgery.' A fascinating linguistic origin for a term now so central to our technological future, especially as we heard with Tesla's latest strategic pivot towards robotics! That's all for today's Quick News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. I'm Arjav, and we'll see you next time.
