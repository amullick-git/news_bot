    "summary": "<p>Hi HN, I built Beni (<a href=\"https://thebeni.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://thebeni.ai</a>\n), a web app for real-time video calls with an AI companion.<p>The idea started as a pretty simple question: text chatbots are everywhere, but they rarely feel present. I wanted something closer to a call, where the character actually reacts in real time (voice, timing, expressions), not just \u201ctype, wait, reply\u201d.<p>Beni is basically:<p>A Live2D avatar that animates during the call (expressions + motion driven by the conversation)<p>Real-time voice conversation (streaming response, not \u201cwait 10 seconds then speak\u201d)<p>Long-term memory so the character can keep context across sessions<p>The hardest part wasn\u2019t generating text, it was making the whole loop feel synchronized: mic input, model response, TTS audio, and Live2D animation all need to line up or it feels broken immediately. I ended up spending more time on state management, latency and buffering than on prompts.<p>Some implementation details (happy to share more if anyone\u2019s curious):<p>Browser-based real-time calling, with audio streaming and client-side playback control<p>Live2D rendering on the front end, with animation hooks tied to speech / state<p>A memory layer that stores lightweight user facts/preferences and conversation summaries to keep continuity<p>Current limitation: sign-in is required today (to persist memory and prevent abuse). I\u2019m adding a guest mode soon for faster try-out and working on mobile view now.<p>What I\u2019d love feedback on:<p>Does the \u201creal-time call\u201d loop feel responsive enough, or still too laggy?<p>Any ideas for better lip sync / expression timing on 2D/3D avatars in the browser?<p>Thanks, and I\u2019ll be around in the comments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46759627\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46759627</a></p>\n<p>Points: 26</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>",

    "summary": "<p>To power the firewalling for our agents so that they couldn't contact arbitrary services, I build netfence. It's like Envoy but for eBPF filters.<p>It allows you to define different DNS-based rules that are resolved in a local daemon to IPs, then pushed to the eBPF filter to allow traffic. By doing it this way, we can still allow DNS-defined rules, but prevent contacting random IPs.<p>There's also no network performance penalty, since it's just DNS lookups and eBPF filters referencing memory.<p>It also means you don't have to tamper with the base image, which the agent could potentially manipulate to remove rules (unless you prevent root maybe).<p>It automatically manages the lifecycle of eBPF filters on cgroups and interfaces, so it works well for both containers and micro VMs (like Firecracker).<p>You implement a control plane, just like Envoy xDS, which you can manage the rules of each cgroup/interface. You can even manage DNS through the control plane to dynamically resolve records (which is helpful as a normal DNS server doesn't know which interface/cgroup a request might be coming from).<p>We specifically use this to allow our agents to only contact S3, pip, apt, and npm.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46754724\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46754724</a></p>\n<p>Points: 47</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>",
