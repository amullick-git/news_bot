HOST: Good evening and welcome to Quick News Briefing! On this day, February 25th, in 1956, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union began, a landmark event that initiated de-Stalinization and reshaped global geopolitics. Today we see how internal political shifts continue to ripple worldwide. We're covering major developments from BBC News, NDTV News, US Top News and Analysis, and many others. Let's dive right in with the latest from Washington.

HOST: The political stage in the U.S. remains highly charged, particularly in the wake of President Trump's recent State of the Union address. What are the key takeaways from that speech and its immediate aftermath?

REPORTER: President Trump delivered his longest ever State of the Union, nearly two hours, proclaiming the U.S. is "winning again" and making various claims about his record, which subsequently underwent extensive fact-checking.

HOST: And the opposition's response?

REPORTER: House Democrats, meeting at their annual policy retreat, expressed optimism for the 2026 midterms. They emphasized economic concerns, positioning themselves to challenge Republicans for control of Congress, looking to capitalize on five key points highlighted from the State of the Union.

HOST: Meanwhile, the President's plans for Iran are still under scrutiny.

REPORTER: Indeed. Following the address, the world waits for President Trump to clarify his strategy for Iran. Crucially, the next round of U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva this Thursday are anticipated to play a decisive role in shaping his ultimate decisions.

HOST: Beyond the State of the Union, there's been other significant news concerning the Trump administration. First, can you tell us about the Surgeon General pick?

REPORTER: The President's pick for Surgeon General sidestepped questions regarding vaccines during Wednesday's proceedings. This comes as the Cuban government also announced it killed four people aboard a U.S. boat, adding another layer to the day's events.

HOST: And we're also hearing about personnel changes at the FBI.

REPORTER: Yes, Director Patel has fired FBI personnel who were tied to inquiries into President Trump and classified records. These firings are described as part of a broader series of retributions aimed at individuals who worked on the two federal prosecutions against him.

HOST: There are also concerns being raised about the President's influence over future elections.

REPORTER: Reports indicate President Trump's push for increased election power is raising fears that he aims to "subvert" the midterms. Critics suggest he is undermining public faith in the electoral outcome at a crucial time when Republicans face an uphill battle to retain control of Congress.

HOST: Now, turning our attention internationally, some surprising news from the Middle East regarding U.S. embassy services.

REPORTER: For the first time, the U.S. will offer embassy services in a West Bank settlement. This move has drawn uniform responses from Palestinians and Israelis across the political spectrum, who all view it as a step towards legitimizing Israeli settlements, which most of the world considers illegal.

HOST: From the Middle East, we move to Mexico, which is grappling with deadly cartel violence.

REPORTER: BBC International Correspondent Quentin Sommerville traveled to Culiacán in northern Sinaloa state following a dramatic escalation of violence. Reports detail a city gripped by cartel activity.

HOST: And the aftermath of a major raid in Tapalpa?

REPORTER: Times reporters visiting Tapalpa found a serene town in shock after Sunday's raid on its outskirts, which left dozens dead and residents fleeing. Surprisingly, there was no immediate police or military presence at the battle site itself, where the cartel leader known as El Mencho reportedly made his last stand.

HOST: Switching gears to another international incident, a harrowing account from a journalist about a mob attack.

REPORTER: A journalist has recounted the terrifying night a mob torched the Daily Star newspaper building. Twenty-eight staff members were trapped on the roof as the building burned, detailing a dire situation where one reporter said, "I can't breathe anymore.".

HOST: And a historical declassification from Spain?

REPORTER: After more than four decades of conjecture, the Spanish government has moved to publish documents from a long-secret investigation into a failed 1981 coup. This decision aims to finally shed light on why the coup failed.

HOST: Finally, let's talk about the pervasive topic of Artificial Intelligence and its impact. There's new data suggesting a surprising group is feeling the most anxiety about AI.

REPORTER: That's right. The prospect of being replaced by AI is creating more fear among higher-income workers than those in lower income brackets, as the threat of automation grows.

HOST: And how reliable are the tools meant to detect AI-generated content?

REPORTER: Artificial intelligence detection tools are increasingly used to verify online content. After running over 1,000 tests, it was found that while these tools show several strengths in identifying fake images and videos, they also have plenty of weaknesses, indicating they are not foolproof.

HOST: And Google is jumping into the AI education space.

REPORTER: Google has rolled out a new AI Career Certificate, designed as a gateway to tomorrow's tech jobs. This program offers practical skills and the opportunity to build a project portfolio, aiming to equip students with real-world artificial intelligence capabilities.

HOST: That's a comprehensive look at today's top stories. Before we go, here's a surprising fact: Did you know that the fastest internet speed ever recorded in a lab reached 178 terabits per second, enough to download the entire Netflix library in less than a second? It’s a glimpse into the future of ultra-high-speed communication.

HOST: That wraps up Quick News Briefing for today. Thank you for joining us. We hope you have a great evening.
