    "title": "Show HN: Sandboxing untrusted code using WebAssembly",
    "summary": "<p>Hi everyone,<p>I built a runtime to isolate untrusted code using wasm sandboxes.<p>Basically, it protects your host system from problems that untrusted code can cause. We\u2019ve had a great discussion about sandboxing in Python lately that elaborates a bit more on the problem [1]. In TypeScript, wasm integration is even more natural thanks to the close proximity between both ecosystems.<p>The core is built in Rust. On top of that, I use WASI 0.2 via wasmtime and the component model, along with custom SDKs that keep things as idiomatic as possible.<p>For example, in Python we have a simple decorator:<p><pre><code>  from capsule import task\n\n  @task(\n      name=\"analyze_data\", \n      compute=\"MEDIUM\",\n      ram=\"512mb\",\n      allowed_files=[\"./authorized-folder/\"],\n      timeout=\"30s\", \n      max_retries=1\n  )\n  def analyze_data(dataset: list) -> dict:\n      \"\"\"Process data in an isolated, resource-controlled environment.\"\"\"\n      # Your code runs safely in a Wasm sandbox\n      return {\"processed\": len(dataset), \"status\": \"complete\"}\n</code></pre>\nAnd in TypeScript we have a wrapper:<p><pre><code>  import { task } from \"@capsule-run/sdk\"\n\n  export const analyze = task({\n      name: \"analyzeData\", \n      compute: \"MEDIUM\", \n      ram: \"512mb\",\n      allowedFiles: [\"./authorized-folder/\"],\n      timeout: 30000, \n      maxRetries: 1\n  }, (dataset: number[]) => {\n      return {processed: dataset.length, status: \"complete\"}\n  });\n</code></pre>\nYou can set CPU (with compute), memory, filesystem access, and retries to keep precise control over your tasks.<p>It's still quite early, but I'd love feedback. I\u2019ll be around to answer questions.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/mavdol/capsule\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/mavdol/capsule</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46500510\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46500510</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46871387\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46871387</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "title": "Show HN: Inverting Agent Model (App as Clients, Chat as Server and Reflection)",
    "summary": "<p>Hello HN. \nI\u2019d like to start by saying that I am a developer who started this research project to challenge myself. I know standard protocols like MCP exist, but I wanted to explore a different path and have some fun creating a communication layer tailored specifically for desktop applications.<p>The project is designed to handle communication between desktop apps in an agentic manner, so the focus is strictly on this IPC layer (forget about HTTP API calls).<p>At the heart of RAIL (Remote Agent Invocation Layer) are two fundamental concepts. The names might sound scary, but remember this is a research project:<p>Memory Logic Injection + Reflection\nParadigm shift: The Chat is the Server, and the Apps are the Clients.<p>Why this approach? The idea was to avoid creating huge wrappers or API endpoints just to call internal methods. Instead, the agent application passes its own instance to the SDK (e.g., RailEngine.Ignite(this)).<p>Here is the flow that I find fascinating:<p>-The App passes its instance to the RailEngine library running inside its own process.<p>-The Chat (Orchestrator) receives the manifest of available methods.The Model decides what to do and sends the command back via Named Pipe.<p>-The Trigger: The RailEngine inside the App receives the command and uses Reflection on the held instance to directly perform the .Invoke().<p>Essentially, I am injecting the \"Agent Logic\" directly into the application memory space via the SDK, allowing the Chat to pull the trigger on local methods remotely.<p>A note on the Repo: The GitHub repository has become large. The core focus is RailEngine and RailOrchestrator. You will find other connectors (C++, Python) that are frankly \"trash code\" or incomplete experiments. I forced RTTR in C++ to achieve reflection, but I'm not convinced by it. Please skip those; they aren't relevant to the architectural discussion.<p>I\u2019d love to focus the discussion on memory-managed languages (like C#/.NET) and ask you:<p>-Architecture: Does this inverted architecture (Apps \"dialing home\" via IPC) make sense for local agents compared to the standard Server/API model?<p>-Performance: Regarding the use of Reflection for every call\u2014would it be worth implementing a mechanism to cache methods as Delegates at startup? Or is the optimization irrelevant considering the latency of the LLM itself?<p>-Security: Since we are effectively bypassing the API layer, what would be a hypothetical security layer to prevent malicious use? (e.g., a capability manifest signed by the user?)<p>I would love to hear architectural comparisons and critiques.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46871251\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46871251</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Hi all, Aram and Eduard here - co-founders of Modelence (<a href=\"https://modelence.com\">https://modelence.com</a>). After spending years on scaling our previous startup\u2019s platform, we built an open-source full-stack TypeScript + MongoDB framework to stop solving the same auth / database / API / cron job implementations every time we created an app, and we didn\u2019t like the idea of using multiple managed platforms for each of these to run our apps either.<p>(Here\u2019s our prior Show HN post for reference: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44902227\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44902227</a>)<p>At the same time, we were excited by the whole AI app builder boom and realized that the real challenge there is the platform rather than the tool itself. Now we\u2019re making Modelence the first full-stack framework that\u2019s built for coding agents and humans alike:<p>- TypeScript is already great for AI coding because it provides guardrails and catches many errors at build time, so agents can auto-correct<p>- MongoDB eliminates the schema management problem for agents, which is where they fail the most often otherwise (+ works great with TS/Node.js)<p>- Built-in auth, database, cron jobs and else that just works together out of the box means agents only focus on your product logic and don\u2019t fail at trying to set these things up (+ less tokens spent on boilerplate).<p>You can now try the Modelence app builder (based on Claude Agent SDK) by just typing a prompt on our landing page ( <a href=\"https://modelence.com\">https://modelence.com</a> ) - watch a demo video here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BPsYvj_nGuE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/BPsYvj_nGuE</a><p>Then you can check it out locally and continue working in your own IDE, while still using Modelence Cloud as your backend, with a dev cloud environment, and later deploy and run on Modelence Cloud with built-in observability around every operation running in your app.<p>We\u2019re also going to add a built-in DevOps agent that lives in the same cloud, knows the framework end-to-end, and will use all this observability data to act on errors, alerts, and incidents - closing the loop, because running in production is much harder than just building.<p>We launched the app builder as a quick start for developers, to demonstrate the framework and Modelence Cloud without having to manually read docs and follow the steps to set up a new app. Our main focus is still the platform itself, since we believe the real challenge in AI coding is the framework and the platform rather than the builder tool itself.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46872733\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46872733</a></p>\n<p>Points: 67</p>\n<p># Comments: 38</p>",
