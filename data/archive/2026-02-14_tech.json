It's hard to piece everything together into a coherent system.<p>The Solution:\nI decided to open-source my learning notes and build them into a structured book. My goal is to help developers fast-track their learning curve.<p>Key Features:<p>LLM-Centric: Focuses on data pipelines specifically designed for LLM training and RAG systems.<p>Scenario-Based: Instead of just listing tools, I compare different methods/architectures based on specific business scenarios (e.g., \"When to use Vector DB vs. Keyword Search\").<p>Hands-on Projects: Includes full code for real-world implementations, not just \"Hello World\" examples.<p>This is a work in progress, and I'm treating it as \"Book-as-Code\".
