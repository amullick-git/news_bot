HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily dose of the top stories shaping our world. I’m Arjav, and joining me today with the latest headlines is our esteemed reporter, Arohi.

HOST: Before we dive into today's news, let's take a quick look back 'On This Day in History.' It was on February 26th, 1935, that Scottish physicist Robert Watson-Watt first publicly demonstrated radar to the British Air Ministry, a revolutionary invention that would dramatically alter both warfare and air traffic control. Today, we're bringing you comprehensive coverage, drawing from the BBC News, NDTV News, NPR Topics, and other leading sources worldwide. Arohi, let's start with a significant development regarding international diplomacy and a story that has been developing. The U.S. and Iran are set to hold nuclear talks today, while questions continue to swirl around the president’s broader plans for Iran. What are the key details?

REPORTER: Good morning, Arjav. That's right, U.S. and Iranian officials are scheduled for a third round of nuclear talks today in Geneva. These discussions are particularly pivotal, as they could be decisive in President Trump’s decision-making on Iran following his recent State of the Union address. The international community is closely watching to see how these negotiations unfold and what impact they will have on future U.S.-Iran relations.

HOST: And beyond the diplomatic table, what’s the situation like for ordinary citizens in Iran? We’ve heard reports about the economic impact.

REPORTER: The economic situation in Iran is certainly challenging. The soaring cost of living has left many families struggling to afford even basic necessities. This has created immense pressures within households and, as we've seen, has contributed to mass protests. The struggling economy is significantly changing how families live, adding another layer of complexity to the broader geopolitical landscape.

HOST: This ties into some other significant news we've been following, particularly involving the fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. There have been resignations and ongoing investigations touching prominent institutions.

REPORTER: Indeed. Harvard professor Larry Summers is resigning amid the school’s investigation into his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This follows similar developments, as the World Economic Forum boss, Borge Brende, also quit after a review of his links to Epstein. Brende acknowledged communications with Epstein but stated he was completely unaware of his past criminal activity. The controversy also highlights missing records from the Epstein files, indicating that the full scope of his connections is still being unearthed. Separately, in a development that's emerged alongside these files, there was a report of a gun battle off the coast of Cuba, where four individuals were killed while allegedly attempting to infiltrate the country. Cuban authorities claim these individuals were part of an infiltration attempt by a boat.

HOST: Shifting gears to U.S. domestic politics, we’ve seen considerable discussion around the integrity of elections and the upcoming midterms. There are significant concerns being raised.

REPORTER: That's correct, Arjav. President Trump’s recent rhetoric and push for election power are raising fears that he could potentially 'subvert' the midterms. Critics argue that his statements are undermining Americans’ faith in the outcome, especially at a time when Republicans face an uphill climb to keep control of Congress. The political atmosphere is highly charged, with trust in electoral processes becoming a central talking point.

HOST: In contrast, how are House Democrats approaching the upcoming elections?

REPORTER: House Democrats, at their annual policy retreat following the State of the Union, projected optimism for the midterms. They hammered home economic concerns, which they believe will resonate with voters. Their strategy is clearly focused on highlighting issues of affordability and economic stability as key platforms for the 2026 elections.

HOST: So, it seems the economy isn't just a set of statistics; it's also about public perception.

REPORTER: Absolutely. The notion that 'the economy is a feeling' is gaining traction. Politicians are keenly aware of how affordability is perceived by the public, and they are actively framing their narratives around these sentiments. It's less about the raw numbers and more about how ordinary Americans experience their financial realities day-to-day.

HOST: Let's broaden our view internationally. We have some concerning reports from Mexico and a stark revelation from Nepal. Arohi, what can you tell us about the situation in Mexico?

REPORTER: In Mexico, the city of Culiacán in northern Sinaloa state has been gripped by an explosion of deadly cartel violence. BBC international correspondent Quentin Sommerville traveled to the region, reporting firsthand on the intense and dangerous situation on the streets, highlighting the pervasive impact of organized crime on local communities.

HOST: And a very tragic story emerging from Nepal.

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. New evidence has come to light revealing what happened when 19 people were shot dead in Kathmandu last September during Gen Z protests. Investigations now show that police orders led to these killings, with victims even shot while in school uniform, painting a deeply disturbing picture of the incident.

HOST: Moving to Europe, we have news of a snap election in Denmark. What’s driving this?

REPORTER: The Danish Prime Minister has called a snap election, with the issue of Greenland taking center stage. Donald Trump's past interest in annexing Greenland is likely to dominate the election campaign, making this a highly unusual and intriguing political contest centered around a territorial dispute that gained international attention.

HOST: Now, let's turn our attention to India for some significant domestic news, starting with a political update.

REPORTER: Sunetra Pawar, the wife of the late Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar, has been elected as the new NCP president. This comes exactly one month after Ajit Pawar's tragic death in a chartered plane crash while trying to land at an airfield in Maharashtra’s Baramati. It’s a rapid transition for the party.

HOST: And a shocking traffic incident from Bengaluru.

REPORTER: In Bengaluru, a lorry entered a road from the wrong side, causing a series of collisions. The lorry driver fled the scene immediately after the incident and is yet to be traced, sparking concerns about road safety and accountability in the region.

HOST: On a more environmentally conscious note, there's an impressive green initiative underway in Bengal.

REPORTER: Yes, there is. Bengal is creating an 800-kilometer "Green Wall" along the Jharkhand border. This ambitious project, spearheaded by Dr. Kalyan Rudra, aims to combat air pollution and is a significant step towards environmental protection in the region, creating a green corridor.

HOST: From India to Australia, where we’re seeing a shift in the political landscape after a tragic event.

REPORTER: Following the mass shooting at Bondi Beach, Pauline Hanson and her anti-immigration One Nation party have seen a rise in polls. The incident has seemingly made the party’s platform more palatable for some Australians, marking a notable shift in public sentiment towards immigration policies.

HOST: And back to economic news here in the U.S., specifically concerning tariffs and potential refunds.

REPORTER: The Supreme Court recently declared emergency tariffs illegal, which might sound like good news for consumers. However, the refund process will be quite messy and complex, with businesses being the first in line to receive any money back. This means American shoppers are unlikely to see those tariff costs directly refunded to them.

HOST: Now, for a quick look at the world of sports, specifically international cricket.

REPORTER: South Africa delivered a dominant performance, routing West Indies in a significant match. Ngidi and Rabada were key players, setting the tone early with the ball and picking up five wickets between them, effectively restricting the West Indies batting lineup.

HOST: And the pre-match decisions?

REPORTER: For this T20 World Cup match in Ahmedabad, which was the first 3 PM local time game in the tournament, an unchanged South Africa opted to bowl first. West Indies, on the other hand, made a change, bringing in Chase for Hosein.

HOST: Finally, a glimpse into the world of high finance, with billionaire family offices making some interesting investment moves.

REPORTER: Before the new year, private investment firms of billionaires like Leon Cooperman and the Walton family disclosed bold stock buys. Their portfolios saw investments in diverse sectors including pro soccer, Bitcoin, and semiconductors, indicating a broad and confident approach to their investment strategies as we head into the new quarter.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those in-depth reports.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: Before we wrap up, here's a surprising fun fact for you: did you know that the human brain, when awake, generates about 20 watts of electrical power? That's enough to light a dim lightbulb!

HOST: That's all for today's News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in and staying informed with us. We appreciate you making us a part of your morning. Have a great day, and we'll see you back here tomorrow.
