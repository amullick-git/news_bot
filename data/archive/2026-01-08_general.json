Claude Code has tool use, so a markdown file can run shell commands, write scripts, read files, make API calls. The prompt orchestrates everything.<p>A script that runs your tests and reports results (`run_tests.md`):<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/env claude-run --permission-mode bypassPermissions\n\n    Run ./test/run_tests.sh and summarize what passed and failed.\n</code></pre>\nBecause stdin/stdout work like any Unix program, you can chain them:<p><pre><code>    cat data.json | ./analyze.md > results.txt\n\n    git log -10 | ./summarize.md\n\n    ./generate.md | ./review.md > final.txt\n</code></pre>\nOr mix them with traditional shell scripts:<p><pre><code>    for f in logs/\\*.txt; do\n\n        cat \"$f\" | ./analyze.md >> summary.txt\n\n    done\n</code></pre>\nThis replaced a lot of Python glue code for us. Tasks that needed LLM orchestration libraries are now markdown files composed with standard Unix tools. Composable as building blocks, runnable as cron jobs, etc.<p>One thing we didn't expect is that these are more auditable (and shareable) than shell scripts. Install scripts like `curl -fsSL <a href=\"https://bun.com/install\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bun.com/install</a> | bash` could become:<p><pre><code>    `curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install.md | claude-run`\n</code></pre>\nWhere install.md says something like \"Detect my OS and architecture, download the right binary from GitHub releases, extract to ~/.local/bin, update my shell config.\" A normal human can actually read and verify that.<p>The (really cool) executable markdown idea and auditability examples are from Pete Koomen (@koomen on X). As Pete says: \"Markdown feels increasingly important in a way I'm not sure most people have wrapped their heads around yet.\"<p>We implemented it and added Unix pipe semantics. Currently works with Claude Code - hoping to support other AI coding tools too. You can also route scripts through different cloud providers (AWS Bedrock, etc.) if you want separate billing for automated jobs.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/andisearch/claude-switcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/andisearch/claude-switcher</a><p>What workflows would you use this for?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46549444\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46549444</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>",

    "summary": "<p>My name is Adrian. I'm a Software Engineer and I spent 6 years developing a perimeter-based geofence-based social media app.<p>What it does:<p>- Allows you to load a custom perimeter anywhere on the geographic map (180\u00b0 E and W longitude and 90\u00b0 N and S latitude), to cover area any area of interest<p>- Chat rooms get loaded within the perimeter<p>- You can chat with people within the perimeter<p>I developed a mobile app that uses an advanced geofence-based networking system from 2013 to 2019. My goal was to connect users within polygon geofences anywhere in the world. The app is capable of loading millions of polygon geofences anywhere in the world.<p><a href=\"https://enterpriseandroidfoundation.com/assets/images/other/manhattan-polygon-geofences.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://enterpriseandroidfoundation.com/assets/images/other/...</a><p>But people didn't really have a need for this. So after failing, I spent the next 6 years trying new ideas to use FencedIn for. I tried a location-based video app and a place-based app that had multiple features. Nothing worked, but now I'm almost finished developing ChatLocal, an app that allows you to load a perimeter anywhere on the geographic map, which loads chat rooms.<p>The tech stack is 100% Java (low-level mostly). I have a backend, commons library and an Android app. Java was the natural choice back in 2013. However, I still wouldn't choose anything else today. Java is the best for long-term large-scale projects. (I'm also using WildFly. PostgreSQL and a Linux server.)<p>This app is still not fully finished, but I think the impact on society might be tremendous.<p>The previous app to ChatLocal, LocalVideo, is fully up on the Google Play store and can be tested. It has 88% of the features of ChatLocal, including especially the perimeter-based loading system.<p>The feedback I'm mostly looking for is new ideas and concepts to add to this location-based social media app. And how strong of a value proposition does the app have for society.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46546349\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46546349</a></p>\n<p>Points: 44</p>\n<p># Comments: 23</p>",
