It also scans the entire IPv4 space for DNS servers and indexes them.\nI'm working on adding more data and tools.<p>I feel like I've developed tunnel vision, so if you see anything that feels off, let me know!<p>I'll keep Wirewiki open and free. Once it has a substantial amount of users, I'll open it up to sponsorship / brand integration from hosting providers, registrars and CDNs, as users will likely be in the market for those.
