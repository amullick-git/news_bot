    "summary": "<p>Why - I got sick of apps abusing notifications on my Android phone. While the OS does give you the ability to switch off notifications based on channels, most apps either don't use it or abuse it intentionally. In my case, I live in a gated society that uses an app called MyGate to allow visitors, and the app intentionally pushes ads through the same channels since you cannot block them.<p>What - DoNotNotify is an app that logs all incoming notifications, and displays them grouped by app. It also captures the action behind the notification, which can be triggered from the app itself. From this log, you can create rules to whitelist/blacklist notifications from apps depending on their notification content. These filters can even be regex expressions, which allows for more complicated use-cases. The app ships with some pre-defined rules for popular apps like Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Netflix, TikTok, Reddit etc.<p>Where - The website is at <a href=\"https://donotnotify.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://donotnotify.com/</a>.<p>Would also like to call out that the app runs purely on your device, never communicates with anything on the Internet, and only requires notifications access to work. It is completely free, and there is no advertising or hidden gotchas.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499646\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499646</a></p>\n<p>Points: 290</p>\n<p># Comments: 125</p>",
