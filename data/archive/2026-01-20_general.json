    "summary": "<p>Hello :-)<p>I have a Discord server I set up a long time ago. Around 2016 I think. Back then, it was lively and active and loads of fun. Over time it's developed close to 5,000 members (it actually had over 5,000 members at one point) and currently has 501 members online as I type this. It's more likely there's about 10-15 that are paying attention to anything happening.<p>It's a Discord that originally focused on DevOps. It complemented my YouTube channel on the same topic, but since then, as it's slowly died out, and my channel's focus as shifted and changed, it's become a bit of a waste land.<p>It's a shame really, because a really fun Discord server can be a great place to be, but I'm not sure where to take it now.<p>How would you handle this situation? What would be your approach to reviving the Discord and perhaps trying to get a community of like minded hackers going again in 2026?<p>I won't link the Discord here as I'm not trying to beg for users or spam. I just genuinely want to work on a solution to improve the life of the server. I will put it in my HN profile, though, so if you do want to check it out that extra step is required.<p>Are people even interested in Discord servers any more? I don't know.<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46697735\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46697735</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>",

    "title": "Show HN: Mastra 1.0, open-source JavaScript agent framework from the Gatsby devs",
    "summary": "<p>Hi HN, we're Sam, Shane, and Abhi.<p>Almost a year ago, we first shared Mastra here (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43103073\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43103073</a>). It\u2019s kind of fun looking back since we were only a few months into building at the time. The HN community gave a lot of enthusiasm and some helpful feedback.<p>Today, we released Mastra 1.0 in stable, so we wanted to come back and talk about what\u2019s changed.<p>If you\u2019re new to Mastra, it's an open-source TypeScript agent framework that also lets you create multi-agent workflows, run evals, inspect in a local studio, and emit observability.<p>Since our last post, Mastra has grown to over 300k weekly npm downloads and 19.4k GitHub stars. It\u2019s now Apache 2.0 licensed and runs in prod at companies like Replit, PayPal, and Sanity.<p>Agent development is changing quickly, so we\u2019ve added a lot since February:<p>- Native model routing: You can access 600+ models from 40+ providers by specifying a model string (e.g., `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`) with TS autocomplete and fallbacks.<p>- Guardrails: Low-latency input and output processors for prompt injection detection, PII redaction, and content moderation. The tricky thing here was the low-latency part.<p>- Scorers: An async eval primitive for grading agent outputs. Users were asking how they should do evals. We wanted to make it easy to attach to Mastra agents, runnable in Mastra studio, and save results in Mastra storage.<p>- Plus a few other features like AI tracing (per-call costing for Langfuse, Braintrust, etc), memory processors, a `.network()` method that turns any agent into a routing agent, and server adapters to integrate Mastra within an existing Express/Hono server.<p>(That last one took a bit of time, we went down the ESM/CJS bundling rabbithole, ran into lots of monorepo issues, and ultimately opted for a more explicit approach.)<p>Anyway, we'd love for you to try Mastra out and let us know what you think. You can get started with `npm create mastra@latest`.<p>We'll be around and happy to answer any questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46693959\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46693959</a></p>\n<p>Points: 100</p>\n<p># Comments: 38</p>",
