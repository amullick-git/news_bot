Instead of running Renovate as a cron job or relying on hosted services, this operator lets you manage it as a native Kubernetes resource with CRDs. You define your repos and config declaratively, and the operator handles scheduling and execution inside your cluster. No external dependencies, no SaaS lock-in, no webhook setup. The whole thing is open source and will stay that way \u2013 there's no paid tier or monetization plan behind it, we just needed this ourselves and figured others might too.<p>Would love to hear feedback or ideas if you give it a try: <a href=\"https://github.com/mogenius/renovate-operator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/mogenius/renovate-operator</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46975449\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46975449</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",
