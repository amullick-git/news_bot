HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I'm Arjav, and joining me, as always, is our intrepid reporter, Arohi, bringing us the latest from around the globe. On this day in history, January 24th, 1984, Apple unveiled the Macintosh computer, a pioneering moment for consumer gadgets and personal technology. Today, we’re covering breaking news from BBC News, Hacker News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, CNBC, and other key sources. Let's dive right in.

REPORTER: Thanks, Arjav. We start with some deeply concerning news out of Minnesota. Governor Walz has publicly called on President Trump to halt all Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, operations in the state following a fatal shooting. Walz stated, "Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota.".

HOST: A very strong statement from the Governor. Do we have more details on the incident that prompted this?

REPORTER: Absolutely. The shooting involved Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an ICU nurse at the VA hospital, who was tragically shot and killed by immigration agents on a Minneapolis street. Those who knew him said he wanted to be a 'force of good in the world.' His death has clearly ignited a fierce debate about the conduct of ICE operations.

HOST: And this isn't just a localized issue, is it? We're seeing similar discussions at a national level.

REPORTER: That's right. In Texas, a recent debate between Democrats running for the U.S. Senate, Jasmine Crockett and James Talarico, highlighted this very concern. While differing in political styles, both agreed on the necessity for an overhaul of ICE and the need to hold violent immigration agents accountable. The pressure for reform appears to be mounting from various political corners.

HOST: A critical and developing story we'll be watching closely. Switching gears now, let's talk about the weather. It seems much of the U.S. is grappling with a massive winter storm.

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. A significant winter storm is currently sweeping across two-thirds of the United States. We're seeing widespread impacts, with stunning images emerging from across the country illustrating snow-covered streets and communities preparing for even worse conditions to come. It's a severe event affecting millions.

HOST: And the extreme weather isn't confined to North America. We're seeing reports of severe conditions elsewhere, too.

REPORTER: Unfortunately, yes. In Afghanistan, heavy snow and rainfall have claimed 61 lives and injured 110 over the past three days. The country's disaster management authority reports hundreds of homes have been destroyed, with storms impacting 15 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. It's a dire humanitarian situation unfolding there.

HOST: Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by these severe weather events. Moving on, let's shift our focus to international relations and U.S. foreign policy. There’s been some interesting rhetoric recently from President Trump regarding allied forces.

REPORTER: That's correct. President Trump recently praised UK soldiers in Afghanistan as being "among the greatest of all warriors." This statement comes shortly after his previous claim that allied forces avoided the front lines during the Afghanistan conflict, so it marks a notable shift in his public comments regarding their contributions.

HOST: And this seemingly comes amid a broader re-evaluation of U.S. support for allies.

REPORTER: Precisely. A new national defense strategy document indicates the U.S. will be offering "more limited" support to its allies moving forward. This represents a strategic shift in how the Pentagon intends to engage globally, potentially impacting security arrangements worldwide.

HOST: That sounds like it could have significant ramifications for global trade as well.

REPORTER: It certainly does. U.S. trade policy is having ripple effects, particularly impacting the Canadian auto industry. It has been so devastated that it's pushed Canada to reach an agreement that will make it easier for Chinese companies to sell cars there. This reflects a broader realignment in global supply chains and trade partnerships.

HOST: From geopolitics, let's turn our attention to the world of technology, specifically artificial intelligence. The recent World Economic Forum in Davos brought AI to the forefront, but also highlighted other pressing global concerns.

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. While many investors arrived in Davos chasing AI's future, a second narrative emerged, gripped by concerns over Greenland, tariffs, and the geopolitical risks reshaping investment strategies. Essentially, two Davos's emerged: one focused on tech, the other on global instability.

HOST: But AI was certainly a dominant theme, particularly for tech leaders.

REPORTER: Absolutely. Tech executives at Davos were predominantly focused on artificial intelligence. Four key themes were top of mind for them, all revolving around AI's rapid advancements and implications. It’s the talk of the industry. However, this excitement isn't without its downsides.

HOST: And what would those be?

REPORTER: Therapists are reporting a noticeable increase in workers expressing anxiety about artificial intelligence. Many are grappling with a "fear of becoming obsolete," a very real concern as AI capabilities expand into more job sectors. It's becoming a significant mental health topic.

HOST: That fear is understandable. Speaking of AI's impact, we've also seen major shifts within tech giants themselves.

REPORTER: Yes, Meta's Reality Labs recently implemented cuts, which have sparked fears of a "VR winter." The company is reportedly deprioritizing virtual reality in favor of artificial intelligence and Internet-connected smart glasses, raising concerns about the immediate future of the broader VR industry.

HOST: So, with AI permeating so many aspects of our lives, is there such a thing as an "AI-proof" business anymore?

REPORTER: It seems there might be, Arjav, in unexpected places. Take Daniel Tom, for instance. He launched Bay Area Sanitation in 2023 with 100 rentable porta-potties. Today, his 31-year-old company rents out nearly 2,000 units and brings in $4.3 million a year. He proudly calls it a "low-tech, AI-proof business." It just goes to show you don't always need cutting-edge tech to succeed. On a more technical note, the concept of "agent orchestration" is gaining traction for those looking to manage and coordinate various AI systems, particularly for specific tasks, demonstrating the growing complexity of AI deployment.

HOST: Fascinating how some businesses thrive by staying grounded. Well, that’s all the time we have for our Quick News Briefing today. Before we go, here's a surprising fact: While we often associate AI with futuristic concepts, the term "robot" itself has a much older origin. It comes from the Czech word 'robota,' meaning "forced labor" or "drudgery," first popularized in a 1920 play by Karel Čapek titled "R.U.R." or "Rossum's Universal Robots." It shows that the concept of artificial workers has captivated us for over a century.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those excellent reports.

REPORTER: My pleasure.

HOST: And thank you for tuning in. We'll be back tomorrow with more. Until then, stay informed and have a great evening.
