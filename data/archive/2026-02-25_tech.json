    "title": "Launch HN: TeamOut (YC W22) \u2013 AI agent for planning company events",
    "summary": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m Vincent, CTO of TeamOut (<a href=\"https://www.teamout.com/\">https://www.teamout.com/</a>). We build an AI agent that plans company events from start to finish entirely through conversation. Similar to how Lovable helps build websites through chat, we apply that approach to event planning. Our system handles venue sourcing, vendor coordination, flight cost estimation, itinerary building, and overall project management.<p>Here\u2019s a demo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVyc-x-isjI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVyc-x-isjI</a>. The product is live at <a href=\"https://app.teamout.com/ai\">https://app.teamout.com/ai</a> and does not require signup.<p>We went through YC in 2022 but did not launch on HN at the time. Back then, the product was more traditional, closer to an Airbnb-style search marketplace. Over the past two years, after helping organize more than 1,200 events, we rebuilt the core system around an agent architecture that directly manages the planning process. With this new version live, it felt like the right moment to share it here since it represents a fundamentally different approach to planning events.<p>The problem: Planning a company retreat usually means choosing between three imperfect options: (1) Hire an event planner and pay significant fees and venue markups; (2) Do it yourself and spend dozens of hours on research, emails, and negotiation; or (3) Use tools like Airbnb that are not designed for group logistics or meeting space.<p>The difficulty is not just finding a venue. Even for 30 to 50 people, planning turns into weeks of back-and-forth emails for quotes, comparing inconsistent pricing across PDFs, and tracking budgets in spreadsheets. It becomes an ongoing coordination problem with evolving constraints and slow, asynchronous vendor responses. Most existing software is form-driven, but the real workflow is conversational and stateful.<p>Offsites are expensive and high stakes. A single event can represent a significant chunk of a team\u2019s annual budget, and mistakes show up directly as cost overruns or poor experiences. Founders and operators often end up spending time on event logistics instead of their actual work.<p>I ran into this while organizing retreats at a previous company. Before TeamOut, I worked as an AI researcher at IBM on NLP and machine learning systems. Sitting inside long email threads and cost spreadsheets, it did not look like a marketplace gap to me. It looked like a reasoning and state management problem. As large language models improved at multi-step reasoning and tool use, it became realistic to automate the coordination layer itself.<p>Our Solution: The core agent relies on a combination of models such as Gemini, Claude, and GPT. A central LLM-based agent maintains planning context across turns and decides which specialized tool to call next.\nEach tool has a specific responsibility: - Venue search and filtering - Cost estimations (accommodation + flights) - Budget comparisons - Quote and outreach flows - Communication tool with our team<p>For venue recommendations across more than 10,000 venues, we do not rely purely on the language model. We embed both user requirements and venues into vector representations and retrieve candidates using similarity search. Hard constraints such as capacity and dates are applied first, and results are ranked before being presented.<p>On the interface side, we use a split layout: conversation on the left and structured results on the right. As you refine the plan in chat, the event updates in real time, allowing an iterative workflow rather than a static search experience.<p>What is different is that we treat event planning as a stateful coordination problem rather than a one-shot search query. The agent orchestrates tools, manages evolving constraints, and surfaces trade-offs explicitly. It does not invent venues or fabricate pricing, and it is not designed to replace human planners for very large or highly customized events.<p>We make money from commissions on venue bookings. It is free for teams to explore options and plan.\nIf you\u2019ve organized an offsite or large meetup before, I\u2019d genuinely value your perspective. Where would you expect this to fail? What edge cases are we underestimating? Where wouldn\u2019t you trust an agent to handle the details?<p>My engineering team and I will be here all day to answer questions, happy to go deep on architecture, tradeoffs, and lessons learned. \nWe\u2019d really appreciate your candid feedback.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47151598\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47151598</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

It's been a weird juxtaposition, though: frontier LLMs can one-shot full coding projects, and those same models struggle to get out of Pok\u00e9mon Red's Mt. Moon.<p>Because of this, I wanted to create a game environment that put this generation of frontier LLMs' top skill, coding, on full display.<p>Ten years ago, a team released a game called Screeps. It was described as an \"MMO RTS sandbox for programmers.\" The Screeps paradigm of writing code and having it executed in a real-time game environment is well suited to LLMs. Drawing on a version of the Screeps open source API, LLM Skirmish pits LLMs head-to-head in a series of 1v1 real-time strategy games.<p>In my testing I found that Claude Opus 4.5 was the most dominant model, but it showed weakness in round 1 as it was overly focused on its in-game economy. Meanwhile, I probably spent a third of all code on sandbox hardening because GPT 5.2 kept trying to cheat by pre-reading its opponent's strategies.<p>If there's interest, I'm planning on doing a round of testing with the latest generation of LLMs (Claude 4.6 Opus, GPT 5.3 Codex, etc.).<p>You can run local matches via CLI. I'm running a hosted match runner with Google Cloud Run that uses isolated-vm.

    "summary": "<p>I wanted to share our new speech to text model, and the library to use them effectively. We're a small startup (six people, sub-$100k monthly GPU budget) so I'm proud of the work the team has done to create streaming STT models with lower word-error rates than OpenAI's largest Whisper model. Admittedly Large v3 is a couple of years old, but we're near the top the HF OpenASR leaderboard, even up against Nvidia's Parakeet family. Anyway, I'd love to get feedback on the models and software, and hear about what people might build with it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47143755\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47143755</a></p>\n<p>Points: 276</p>\n<p># Comments: 65</p>",
