Should I Walk or Drive?\" This question has been making the rounds as a simple AI logic test so I wanted to see how it holds up across a broad set of models. Ran 53 models (leading open-source, open-weight, proprietary) with no system prompt, forced choice between drive and walk, with a reasoning field.<p>On a single run, only 11 out of 53 got it right (42 said walk). But a single run doesn't prove much, so I reran every model 10 times. Same prompt, no cache, clean slate.<p>The results got worse. Of the 11 that passed the single run, only 5 could do it consistently. GPT-5 managed 7/10. GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, every Llama and Mistral model scored 0/10 across all 10 runs.<p>People kept saying humans would fail this too, so I got a human baseline through Rapidata (10k people, same forced choice): 71.5% said drive. Most models perform below that.<p>All reasoning traces (ran via Opper, my startup), full model breakdown, human baseline data, and raw JSON files are in the writeup for anyone who wants to dig in or run their own analysis.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47128138\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47128138</a></p>\n<p>Points: 301</p>\n<p># Comments: 369</p>",

    "summary": "<p>We returned to MIT last month to teach a revised version of Missing Semester, six years after the original debut (which has been extensively discussed on HN, in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22226380\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22226380</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34934216\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34934216</a>).<p>We\u2019ve updated the course based on our personal experiences as well as major changes in the field (e.g., the proliferation of AI-powered developer tools) over the past several years. The 2026 course includes revised versions of four lectures from the previous course, and it adds five entirely new lectures:<p>- Development Environment and Tools<p>- Packaging and Shipping Code<p>- Agentic Coding<p>- Beyond the Code (soft skills)<p>- Code Quality<p>We\u2019d love to hear any feedback from the HN community to improve the current or future iterations of the course. In particular, we\u2019re curious to hear the community\u2019s take on our inclusion of AI-related topics (e.g., dedicating an entire class to the topic of agentic coding; though we tried to counterbalance it with plenty of disclaimers, and a dedicated section on AI etiquette in Beyond the Code).<p>--Anish, Jon, and Jose</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47124171\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47124171</a></p>\n<p>Points: 147</p>\n<p># Comments: 38</p>",
