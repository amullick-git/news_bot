    "summary": "<p>This is an interactive map of US navigational aids and lighthouses, which indicates their location, color, characteristic and any remarks the Coast Guard has attached.<p>I was sick at home with the flu this weekend, and went on a bit of a Wikipedia deep dive about active American lighthouses. Searching around a bit, it was very hard to find a single source or interactive map of active beacons, and a description of what the \"characteristic\" meant. The Coast Guard maintains a list of active lights though, that they publish annually (<a href=\"https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/light-list-annual-publication\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/light-list-annual-publication</a>). With some help from Claude Code, it wasn't hard to extract the lat/long and put together a small webapp that shows a map of these light stations and illustrates their characteristic with an animated visualization..<p>Of course, this shouldn't be used as a navigational aid, merely for informational purposes! Though having lived in Seattle and San Francisco I thought it was quite interesting.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46756427\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46756427</a></p>\n<p>Points: 86</p>\n<p># Comments: 19</p>",
