HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily dive into the headlines shaping our world. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, ready to bring you the stories that matter.

HOST: Arohi, always a pleasure. Before we jump into today's top stories, let's take a quick look back. On this day in history, January 24th, 1924, the very first Winter Olympic Games officially opened in Chamonix, France, kicking off a tradition that continues to captivate sports enthusiasts worldwide.

HOST: Today, we're covering a wide array of news from across the globe, bringing you updates from BBC News, comprehensive cricket analysis from ESPN Cricinfo.com, in-depth reports from NPR Topics, and insights from many other trusted sources. We'll navigate everything from international cricket triumphs to major geopolitical shifts, immigration crackdowns, technological advancements, and economic discussions. Arohi, let's start with some exciting news from the cricket world.

HOST: Australia is dominating Group A, while Bangladesh shows strong performance. What are the latest developments there and what does this mean for their standing?

REPORTER: That's right. Australia secured the top spot in Group A after an impressive bowling display against Sri Lanka, dismissing them for a mere 58 runs. Fast bowler Will Byrom was the star, picking up 5 for 14, a truly exceptional performance. This victory solidifies Australia's position as a formidable contender early in the tournament. Meanwhile, Bangladesh also had a strong showing, easing past the USA. Iqbal Hossain contributed significantly for Bangladesh with 3 for 41. Both teams are certainly making their presence felt and setting a strong precedent for the matches ahead.

HOST: Shifting gears to the United States, we're seeing continued resistance in Minnesota regarding immigration policies, and this ties into broader discussions about federal use-of-force rules. Arohi, can you bring us up to speed on the situation in Minneapolis and the underlying context?

REPORTER: Absolutely. Residents in downtown Minneapolis recently turned out in frigid cold temperatures to protest the federal government's immigration campaign in the state. These were widespread demonstrations, following weeks of sustained community resistance, with many local businesses closing their doors in solidarity to protest these actions and show support for their immigrant communities. The resolve was clear despite the harsh weather.

REPORTER: This local protest also connects to a larger national conversation, stemming from a deadly standoff back in 1992. That incident, involving white separatists, profoundly changed federal use-of-force rules, leading to new policies for some federal law enforcement agencies. The current situation in Minneapolis is now raising pressing questions about whether it's again time to revisit those policies, especially given recent developments and the need for accountability.

HOST: And those developments include a significant resignation at the FBI, correct?

REPORTER: Precisely. An FBI agent, Tracee Mergen, resigned after attempting to investigate an ICE officer involved in the shooting of Renee Good. This resignation is just the latest in a series of shock waves emerging from the Justice Department's handling of the Renee Good shooting incident, putting a significant spotlight on the complexities of internal investigations and accountability within federal law enforcement agencies. The implications are being closely watched.

HOST: That's a critical and complex situation. Moving to another domestic concern, much of the country is grappling with a severe winter storm. Arohi, what's the latest on that front, and what should our listeners know?

REPORTER: Reporters across the NPR Network are actively covering the widespread impact of this raging winter storm, detailing everything from widespread power outages to hazardous travel conditions. They are also reporting on how state and local officials, emergency services, and utility companies are responding to the challenging conditions. We also have essential tips for listeners on staying safe once bad weather hits, emphasizing preparedness, safe heating practices, and caution during this prolonged period of severe weather.

HOST: From domestic issues to international relations, there's a fascinating and concerning story out of Venezuela. What happened there involving a water balloon fight, and what does it tell us about the current political climate?

REPORTER: It sounds unusual, but it’s a stark illustration of the political climate. A water balloon fight in Venezuela actually led to charges of treason against those involved. While Venezuela’s interim government has received praise from President Trump, it has concurrently maintained a robust state security apparatus, which it uses to suppress any perceived dissent, no matter how minor the initial incident might appear. This incident really underscores the fragility of civil liberties and the severity of state control in the country.

HOST: A very concerning situation indeed, highlighting sensitivities around dissent. Speaking of international relations and leadership, we're hearing about comments from the US Treasury Secretary regarding Alberta separatism, and President Trump's strong statements on Greenland are also making waves globally. Arohi, what's developing here and how are these discussions impacting global perceptions?

REPORTER: These stories are certainly intertwined with broader geopolitical shifts and economic considerations. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently weighed in on the topic of Alberta separatism, describing Canada's oil-rich province as a "natural partner" for the United States. These comments come amid a war of words between Ottawa and Washington, which has included disputes over trade and energy policy, suggesting potential geopolitical realignments or at least heightened tensions within North America.

REPORTER: Compounding these discussions are President Trump’s recent remarks and actions concerning Greenland, which have caused a significant stir on the international stage. Many are suggesting that the world will remember Trump’s Greenland outburst, and opinion pieces are calling for Americans to step up and defend NATO and the country’s vital interests in its survival. There's a strong sense that these comments have implications for alliances and global stability.

HOST: And this wasn't just a political talking point among diplomats and leaders, right? It was also a hot topic among global investors at Davos, shifting their focus.

REPORTER: Exactly. The World Economic Forum in Davos, initially focused heavily on the future of artificial intelligence, saw a clear shift in conversations. Two distinct Davos narratives emerged: one group was indeed chasing AI’s future, but the other, unexpectedly, found itself gripped by discussions around Greenland, rising tariffs, and the broader geopolitical risks that are now fundamentally reshaping investor playbooks and international economic strategies. It highlights how political rhetoric is directly impacting global economic outlooks and investment decisions.

HOST: A fascinating insight into how politics and economy intersect. Moving to a different kind of headline from Australia, there’s news about an increase in shark attacks. What’s behind this "perfect storm" that experts are describing?

REPORTER: Reports indicate four shark attacks in just 48 hours, turning East Australia's beaches into what experts are calling a "perfect storm" for encounters. While human-shark interactions are indeed rising in Australia, experts are very keen to point out that it is not the animals' fault. They attribute the rise to various environmental factors, such as changing ocean temperatures affecting prey distribution, and increased human activity in coastal waters, rather than increased aggression from sharks themselves. It's a complex ecological issue.

HOST: A stark reminder of our coexistence with nature. And tragically, from Indonesia, we have news of a deadly landslide. What's the latest on the rescue efforts?

REPORTER: That's correct. A landslide in West Java, Indonesia, has tragically killed seven people, with dozens more still missing. Rescue teams, including local volunteers and emergency services, are currently working tirelessly and under challenging conditions in the affected village, searching for the 83 individuals who are still unaccounted for amidst the devastation. The search is ongoing, with hopes of finding survivors.

HOST: Our thoughts are with those affected. Now, let's pivot to the tech world, a sector that continues to innovate at a rapid pace. We just touched on AI being a hot topic at Davos, but what were the specific takeaways from tech leaders and investors there regarding its future?

REPORTER: AI was undeniably the dominant theme. I spent the week with tech CEOs at Davos, and four key themes were top of mind for them, all revolving around artificial intelligence. These discussions included the rapid advancements in AI models, their practical applications across industries, the ethical considerations surrounding their deployment, and the competitive landscape for AI innovation.

REPORTER: Further insights from the World Economic Forum reveal that CEOs from various portfolio companies were discussing AI alongside other pressing economic issues like credit card rates and the housing market. But AI remained a central focus, particularly concerning its transformative potential across industries and its long-term economic impact.

HOST: So, while AI is taking center stage, is it also shifting priorities for major tech players, perhaps even at the expense of other emerging technologies? What about virtual reality, for instance?

REPORTER: That's a critical point. Meta's Reality Labs recently made significant cuts, sparking fears of a "VR winter" within the industry. This move signals Meta's strategic shift, as the company is now largely deprioritizing virtual reality investments in favor of artificial intelligence and developing Internet-connected smart glasses. It really indicates where the industry giants see the immediate future of tech and where capital is being reallocated.

HOST: And on the innovation front, we're seeing practical AI applications already available, such as Claude Code, making advanced technology more accessible.

REPORTER: Yes, absolutely. Claude Code is an excellent example of accessible AI. It generates computer code when users type in prompts, effectively democratizing programming. This means individuals with no prior coding experience can now create their own programs and applications, which is a significant leap forward in empowering a broader user base in software development and innovation.

HOST: And what about the employment landscape in AI, with all these rapid advancements?

REPORTER: On that note, Noora Health, for example, a Y Combinator alum specializing in health technology, is actively hiring an AI/ML Engineer. This highlights the growing demand for specialized talent in the artificial intelligence and machine learning fields, underscoring the rapid expansion of the AI sector and the new, high-demand opportunities it presents globally.

HOST: A clear picture of AI's dominance and its ripple effects across the tech landscape. Moving to another tech giant with significant international implications, TikTok has been in the news with a new deal. Arohi, what's the latest on TikTok's efforts to address ongoing concerns about its ties to China and data security?

REPORTER: This is a major development. TikTok has struck a deal to create a new U.S. entity, aiming to significantly loosen the app's ties to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The Chinese parent company announced that a group of non-Chinese investors would create an American TikTok to avoid a potential federal ban, which has been under consideration due to national security and data privacy concerns. This move is a strategic effort to satisfy U.S. regulators.

REPORTER: However, this new U.S. venture comes with specific implications for user data that are raising new questions. Details published in a new privacy policy for the popular social media app indicate that the U.S. entity will collect precise user location data. This expanded access to sensitive information is drawing scrutiny, even as the company tries to distance itself from its Chinese origins and ensure its long-term operation in the American market.

HOST: A complex balancing act for a global platform. Now, turning our attention to India, we have some important news regarding electoral processes and international diplomacy. What's Nobel laureate Amartya Sen flagging in Bengal, and what are his specific concerns?

REPORTER: Amartya Sen, a renowned economist and Nobel laureate, has expressed concerns regarding the pace of the electoral roll revision, or SIR process, in Bengal, stating, "What is happening in Bengal..." and flagging what he perceives as undue haste in the process. He's warned that this speed may potentially hurt democratic principles and fairness. Despite these significant concerns, Sen himself remains keen to cast his vote in the upcoming assembly polls, underscoring his belief in the democratic process.

HOST: And on the international stage, India played a notable role in a recent UNHRC resolution. Can you elaborate on that?

REPORTER: Indeed. Iran has publicly thanked India for its vote against what Iran described as an 'unjust' UNHRC resolution. The resolution itself was adopted by a vote of 25 in favor and 7 against, highlighting India's diplomatic position on certain international issues and its willingness to take a stand that garners appreciation from some nations, even if it differs from the stance of others on the global forum.

HOST: And that brings us to the close of another dynamic News Briefing. Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive reports.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav. Always great to be here.

HOST: Before we sign off, here's a fun fact to brighten your day: Did you know that the "sixth sense" you often hear about in humans, technically known as proprioception, is actually the scientific ability to know where your body parts are in space without looking? It's how you can touch your nose with your eyes closed!

HOST: That's all for today's News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. We'll be back tomorrow with more updates from around the world. Until then, stay informed and have a great day.
