HOST: Good morning! Welcome to News Briefing, your daily dive into the headlines shaping our world. Today is February 24th, and on this day in history, back in 1868, Andrew Johnson became the very first U.S. President to be impeached by the House of Representatives. A significant moment in American political history. We have a packed agenda for you, bringing you the latest from sources like BBC News, NPR Topics, US Top News and Analysis, and many others. From ongoing trade disputes to the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we'll cover the stories you need to know. Joining me, as always, is our intrepid reporter Arohi, ready to break down the most important details. Arohi, let's start with a look at the U.S. trade front, where a lingering issue with tariffs is still making waves. What's the latest?

REPORTER: Good morning. Indeed, it's a significant story with substantial financial implications. Despite a Supreme Court ruling, U.S. importers are still grappling with billions in what have been termed "reciprocal" tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. These tariffs were struck down by the highest court, yet cargo continues to be subjected to them. It creates a complex situation for businesses, adding unforeseen costs and complexities to international trade operations.

HOST: That's a huge issue for businesses. So, even with the Supreme Court ruling, these tariffs are actively impacting the supply chain. What does this mean for different sectors and for international trade relationships?

REPORTER: It means a mixed bag, and not necessarily an equitable one. For the U.S. textile industry, specifically, there's actually a silver lining, with the tariff reset spelling big gains. However, a recent report from a trade body highlights a different picture for U.S. allies. Countries like the U.K. and the European Union are facing higher duties under new tariff structures. Conversely, some rivals, including Brazil, China, and India, are seeing a reprieve. This suggests a strategic realignment of trade policy that benefits certain nations while placing added pressure on traditional partners. In fact, following the SCOTUS decision, China has openly urged Washington to lift tariffs, viewing it as an opportunity to reset trade relations.

HOST: That's a fascinating dynamic, shifting alliances and economic impacts. From trade, let's pivot to U.S. politics. We've had a number of interesting developments surrounding former President Trump. Arohi, tell us about a former FBI official now making a move into the political arena.

REPORTER: We're seeing a notable entry into the political landscape. David Sundberg, who previously led the Washington Field Office of the FBI, and was notably ousted during the Trump administration, has announced his bid for Congress in Maryland. He's joining what's described as a crowded Democratic primary for Steny H. Hoyer’s open House seat. His background as a high-ranking FBI official provides a unique perspective and a strong platform as he enters the political fray.

HOST: An interesting move from a former federal official. On a related note, there was also a memorable interaction reported involving Greenland and the former President's administration. What happened there?

REPORTER: That's right. It was a rather unusual diplomatic exchange. Greenland's Prime Minister issued a clear "no thanks" in response to an offer from the Trump administration to send a U.S. hospital boat to aid its citizens. The former President had stated the boat was for people "allegedly not being taken care of." Greenland’s PM swiftly countered by reminding the administration that Greenland already provides free healthcare to its population. It underscored a misunderstanding of Greenland's internal systems and priorities.

HOST: A direct response there. Let's talk about the domestic political climate ahead of a major address. What are the latest polls indicating about the sentiment of Americans regarding the state of the union?

REPORTER: The data suggests significant political headwinds for President Trump ahead of the State of the Union address. An NPR poll, among others, reveals that most Americans believe the state of the union is not strong and that the U.S. is worse off. This sentiment is broadly consistent across several surveys and indicates a challenging environment for the administration to garner widespread public support for its agenda. This poll information was released ahead of the President's address where he announced he would be raising global tariffs to 15%. This combination of declining public confidence and escalating trade tensions sets a complex backdrop for the upcoming political year.

HOST: Clearly a tough read for the administration on public opinion. And beyond public opinion, there's also been discussion about the broader impact of some of the administration's policies. Specifically, what's been said about the "human cost" of certain decisions?

REPORTER: An opinion piece in The New York Times highlighted what it termed "The Human Cost of the Trump Administration’s War on Science." The focus was on the ripple effects of cuts to H.I.V. research funding. The article argued that such funding reductions have far-reaching negative consequences beyond just the immediate financial impact, affecting public health, scientific progress, and ultimately, human lives. It's a critical perspective on how policy decisions can have tangible, everyday impacts.

HOST: Important considerations indeed. And speaking of the former President, he has also been quite vocal recently about media personalities. What's the latest in that realm?

REPORTER: The former President recently demanded that Netflix fire Susan Rice. This comes after Rice, a former National Security Advisor, argued during a podcast that "it is not going to end well" for corporations, news organizations, and law firms that "bent the knee" to the Trump administration. This demand coincided with the Department of Justice’s ongoing probe into a Warner deal, adding another layer of complexity to the situation. It highlights the continued tensions between political figures and media.

HOST: A very active political landscape, Arohi. Let's shift gears slightly and move to a brighter note, if you will. How did U.S. athletes fare at the Winter Games?

REPORTER: It was a strong showing for the U.S. at the Milan Cortina Winter Games. The U.S. significantly boosted its gold medal tally, solidifying its position as a winter sport powerhouse, second only to Norway. What's particularly interesting is that these wins came disproportionately from athletes who emerged from a handful of states, ranging from Alaska to Vermont. It underscores regional strengths in specific winter sports development within the country.

HOST: That's great to hear about the success of U.S. athletes. Now, let's transition to a sector that continues to dominate headlines and shape our future: Artificial Intelligence. Arohi, there's a new initiative from the U.S. government aimed at expanding its global AI footprint. What can you tell us?

REPORTER: The U.S. has announced the launch of a new "Tech Corps," backed by the Peace Corps, as part of its strategy to spread its global AI influence and counter China's growing presence in the sector. This initiative aims to export American AI technologies and expertise, fostering a global AI ecosystem aligned with U.S. values and standards. It's a significant diplomatic and technological push, emphasizing international collaboration and competition in the AI space.

HOST: That's a clear strategic move on the global stage. Domestically, how is the conversation around AI regulation evolving, particularly as we head into midterm elections?

REPORTER: The political battle over artificial intelligence is definitely escalating, especially with the midterm elections on the horizon. A Super PAC, Public First Action, backed by prominent AI company Anthropic, has begun an ad blitz in support of AI regulation. These ads, which started airing on Monday, are a clear signal of the industry's desire to shape legislative outcomes, indicating that AI regulation will be a key issue in the upcoming political cycle.

HOST: Interesting to see an AI company actively supporting regulation. And speaking of Anthropic, their CEO is reportedly meeting with a key defense official. What's the agenda there?

REPORTER: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is scheduled to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to discuss the use of Anthropic's AI models within the Department of Defense. A key point of discussion will be Anthropic's specific concerns and safeguards. The company has made it clear that it does not want its AI models used for autonomous weapons systems or for spying on American citizens. This meeting highlights the ongoing ethical considerations and the delicate balance between technological advancement and responsible deployment, particularly in sensitive government and defense applications.

HOST: Critical discussions happening at the intersection of AI and national security. Beyond ethical considerations, there are also significant financial implications for the tech giants investing heavily in AI. What's the current state of play for these "hyperscalers"?

REPORTER: The financial landscape for hyperscalers, the major cloud providers and tech giants, is seeing unprecedented shifts due to massive investments in AI. Their AI capital expenditure spending is reportedly approaching "unheard of levels." This "AI debt binge" is challenging what analysts describe as an "unspoken contract" with investors, who historically expected more predictable returns. The scale of these investments indicates a deep commitment to AI, but also raises questions about sustainability and the long-term financial models of these companies.

HOST: A massive financial commitment there. On the business side of AI, how are companies like OpenAI expanding their reach into the enterprise market?

REPORTER: OpenAI is making significant strides in the enterprise sector by securing multiyear deals with major consulting giants. Firms like Accenture, Boston Consulting Group, Capgemini, and McKinsey will now partner with OpenAI. Their role will be to assist OpenAI's enterprise customers in integrating AI agents into real production workflows more quickly. This strategy aims to accelerate the adoption and practical application of OpenAI's advanced AI models across diverse industries, moving beyond experimental phases into tangible business solutions.

HOST: That's a smart move to leverage consulting expertise. However, despite all this rapid advancement and investment, there's a notion that public enthusiasm for the AI boom might not be matching the industry's excitement. Is that accurate?

REPORTER: That perception is certainly gaining traction. Tech leaders are reportedly beginning to express concern about what they see as the public's underwhelming enthusiasm for their ambitious plans to remake the world with artificial intelligence. Unlike the dot-com boom, where public excitement was palpable, there's a lingering question of whether this lack of widespread public fervor could potentially "burst the bubble" for the AI sector. It suggests a need for better public education or perhaps a re-evaluation of how AI benefits are being communicated to the average person.

HOST: That's an interesting parallel to the dot-com era. And speaking of public perception, there have been growing concerns about the environmental impact of AI. How is OpenAI's CEO addressing those criticisms?

REPORTER: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently addressed these concerns head-on, specifically regarding the resource usage of AI. He defended the industry on Friday, arguing that worries about water consumption were "fake" and controversially comparing AI's energy use to human energy consumption. His comments highlight the ongoing debate about the environmental footprint of large language models and the broader AI infrastructure, and the industry's pushback against some of the criticisms.

HOST: A strong defense from Altman there. For those looking to understand the rapid progression of this field, is there a good resource available?

REPORTER: Absolutely. A new interactive tool called "AI Timeline" has been released, charting the evolution of 171 Large Language Models, or LLMs, from the seminal Transformer paper in 2017 all the way up to GPT-5.3 in 2026. It's a comprehensive resource that allows users to filter by open or closed source and tracks 54 different organizations. For anyone trying to grasp the sheer speed and scale of AI development, this timeline offers an invaluable visual guide.

HOST: That sounds like an incredibly useful tool for tracking this fast-moving sector. Finally, Arohi, how are schools responding to this AI revolution? Is "AI literacy" becoming a new educational imperative?

REPORTER: Yes, "AI literacy" is definitely trending in schools across the country. Artificial intelligence companies are actively urging educators to prepare students for an "AI-driven future." What this means in practice, however, varies significantly from school to school. Some are focusing on basic understanding of AI concepts, others on ethical implications, and some on practical application. The push reflects a recognition that AI will be integral to future workforces and daily life, requiring a new set of foundational skills for students.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive updates on such a wide range of important stories.

REPORTER: My pleasure.

HOST: And that brings us to the end of our News Briefing for today. Before we go, here's a surprising fun fact to leave you with: Did you know that the shortest war in recorded history lasted only between 38 and 45 minutes? It was fought between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896. A quick conflict indeed!
