HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I'm Arjav, bringing you the latest headlines from around the globe. Today, January 19th, we’re reflecting on a significant moment in tech history: on this day in 1983, Apple announced the Lisa, one of the first personal computers to feature a graphical user interface. A true precursor to the intuitive systems we use today.

HOST: We've got a packed agenda for you, covering major developments from BBC News, NDTV News, The New York Times, and other key sources. From international diplomacy and economic shifts in India to a tense standoff in the US and the unfolding geopolitical drama around Greenland, there's a lot to unpack. Joining me, as always, is our brilliant reporter, Arohi, to dive into the details. Arohi, let's start with India, where there's been some significant diplomatic activity this week.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. We've seen a flurry of high-level engagements. The UAE President, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, concluded his visit to India with a meeting in New Delhi with Prime Minister Modi on Monday. The focus was firmly on strengthening economic ties and fostering mutual growth, underlining the UAE's commitment to strategic partnership. This signals a deepening relationship between the two nations across various sectors.

HOST: And it wasn't just the UAE. India also hosted another key international figure.

REPORTER: That's right. Poland's Deputy Prime Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, was also in New Delhi, meeting with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Monday. Sikorski expressed Poland's interest in diversifying its trade partners and identified India as a nation highly willing to engage in new economic collaborations. This indicates India's growing appeal on the global stage as a reliable and open partner for trade and investment, moving beyond traditional alliances.

HOST: So, India positioning itself as a key player in the global economy, and speaking of that, there's also news from the World Economic Forum in Davos about GIFT City.

REPORTER: Indeed. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Sanjay Kaul, the Group CEO and Managing Director of GIFT City, highlighted its crucial role in India's rise as a global financial hub. He emphasized how GIFT City is rapidly emerging as an international financial services center, attracting global investment and facilitating India's economic ascent. This really positions India as a significant player in the global financial landscape.

HOST: Fascinating insights into India's economic and diplomatic outreach. Now, let's shift gears slightly and talk some cricket. India was in a series decider against New Zealand. What happened there?

REPORTER: It was a nail-biter, Arjav. In the ODI series decider, India asked New Zealand to bat first, making one change by bringing in Arshdeep Singh for Prasidh Krishna. New Zealand, however, went in with an unchanged playing XI.

HOST: And the outcome?

REPORTER: New Zealand clinched their first-ever ODI series win in India. Centuries from Mitchell and Phillips were instrumental in their victory, ultimately trumping a strong effort from Kohli. There was a significant 99-run seventh-wicket stand between Kohli and Rana that truly threatened to spoil New Zealand's party, but they held on. A historic moment for the Blackcaps.

HOST: A tough one for India, but certainly an exciting series. Now, let's turn our attention to the United States, where domestic tensions and international relations are making headlines. Arohi, what's developing in Minnesota?

REPORTER: Minnesota is on high alert, Arjav. Hundreds of active-duty troops are on standby for deployment amid rising tensions over immigration protests. This comes after a protest at a Minnesota church service added to concerns over ICE tactics, prompting the Justice Department to announce an investigation into the pastor's apparent role in immigration enforcement. The situation remains fluid and highly charged.

HOST: That sounds like a very delicate situation. And broadening our scope to US foreign policy, there's been some notable criticism from within the country and internationally.

REPORTER: Yes, indeed. In a rare move, the three most senior cardinals leading U.S. archdioceses issued a joint statement on Monday, openly denouncing American foreign policy. They stated that recent policies have cast doubt on America's "moral role in confronting evil." This significant rebuke from the Catholic Church leadership highlights growing concerns about the nation's international standing.

HOST: And it seems this sentiment is echoed on the global stage.

REPORTER: That's correct. UN Secretary-General António Guterres told the BBC that the US believes its power matters more than international law, expressing Washington's "clear conviction" that multilateral solutions are increasingly irrelevant. This perspective from the UN chief underscores a significant divergence in approaches to global governance.

HOST: So, a challenging picture for US foreign policy. And this brings us to another major international story: the escalating tensions across Europe regarding President Trump's new threats over Greenland. What's the latest there?

REPORTER: This situation is certainly escalating, Arjav. Pro-Russian government papers are gloating over the Greenland tensions, with Russia's editor at the BBC analyzing why these outlets are full of praise for Donald Trump's desire to buy Greenland. This points to geopolitical ripple effects.

HOST: And how is Europe reacting to these developments and the potential for new tariffs?

REPORTER: European countries are reportedly weighing what's been termed a "trade bazooka" against the US as the Greenland crisis deepens. They are considering retaliatory tariffs and wider economic countermeasures against the US in response to Trump's threats. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, explicitly stated that while the bloc has "no interest to pick a fight, we will hold our ground.".

HOST: So, a very firm stance from the EU. Has President Trump clarified his position on these tariffs?

REPORTER: He has, Arjav. President Trump stated he would "100%" carry out his Greenland tariffs threat. This declaration has sent alarm bells ringing across European businesses. Analysts have already identified European exporters most exposed if these tariffs kick in, signaling a potential significant economic impact across the region.

HOST: With such high stakes, how are other allies responding, particularly the UK?

REPORTER: The UK is attempting to play a mediating role. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for cool heads and urged calm as tensions continue to rise between Washington and its European allies. The UK is looking to work its magic on Trump to defuse the Greenland tariff threat, trying to navigate this complex diplomatic situation.

HOST: A very volatile international landscape indeed, Arohi. Thank you for that comprehensive overview.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And before we sign off tonight, here's a quick, surprising fact related to our world of technology. Did you know the world's first computer programmer wasn't a man, but a woman? Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, created an algorithm for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in the mid-19th century. A remarkable achievement that truly laid the groundwork for modern computing.

HOST: That's all for this edition of Quick News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. We'll be back tomorrow with more updates. Until then, have a good evening.
