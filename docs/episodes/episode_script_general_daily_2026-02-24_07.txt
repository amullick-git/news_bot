HOST: Good morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your essential start to the day. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, bringing you the latest headlines and in-depth analysis from around the globe.

HOST: Today, February 24th, we look back to 1868, when Andrew Johnson made history, becoming the first US President to be impeached by the House of Representatives, setting a precedent in American political history. A stark reminder of the checks and balances at play. We're covering a wide range of stories for you this morning, drawing from top news sources including NDTV News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many others.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. We have a packed agenda, from critical developments in US politics, including President Trump’s State of the Union address, to significant economic shifts, and ongoing international conflicts.

HOST: Let's kick things off with a fascinating local political story out of New York, where a left-leaning group has broken ranks with Mayor Zohran Mamdani over a crucial U.S. House Race. Arohi, what’s happening on the ground there?

REPORTER: Well, Arjav, New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani recently faced a significant setback in his lobbying efforts for a preferred candidate in an upcoming U.S. House race. Mamdani had been actively supporting Claire Valdez, but the influential Working Families Party, a progressive political organization, chose a different path. They ultimately decided to back Antonio Reynoso, the Brooklyn borough president, for the congressional seat instead. This decision represents a notable blow to Mayor Mamdani, highlighting internal divisions within left-leaning political circles and underscoring the complexities of endorsements and alliances in local politics. It certainly signals a challenging dynamic as the election cycle progresses, with powerful endorsements not always aligning with high-profile political figures' personal preferences.

HOST: That's a clear demonstration of the nuanced political landscape. Switching gears now to national politics, the eyes of the nation are on Washington tonight as President Trump prepares to deliver his State of the Union address. This is a monumental event, and the Democrats have already announced their response. What can you tell us about that, Arohi?

REPORTER: Indeed, the Democrats have tapped some prominent figures to deliver their official rebuttal. Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democrats' response following President Trump's State of the Union address. This is a crucial role, as the response often sets the tone for the opposition's agenda moving forward. Spanberger is a rising star within the party, known for her focus on affordability issues, which propelled her to victory in 2025. Her selection signals the Democrats' intent to highlight economic concerns and propose alternative solutions to the administration's policies. Her address will be a prime opportunity to frame the upcoming midterm elections.

HOST: And speaking of the State of the Union, Arohi, there's also been an NPR investigation raising questions about some files related to former President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein. Can you shed some light on that, as well as what else to anticipate from the President’s speech?

REPORTER: That's right. An NPR investigation has revealed that the Department of Justice withheld certain Epstein files that were related to abuse allegations against President Trump. This development adds another layer to the ongoing public interest surrounding the Epstein case and its broader implications. The withholding of these specific documents raises questions and is certainly a topic that will continue to draw scrutiny. As for tonight's State of the Union address, it comes at a pivotal moment. The president is expected to tout his administration's accomplishments and lay out his vision for the future, particularly ahead of this year's midterm elections. Observers will be looking for insights into his legislative priorities and campaign messaging.

HOST: And the economic backdrop for the State of the Union is particularly interesting. Reports suggest that voters are souring on the current administration's economic policies, even as the President prepares to highlight his record.

REPORTER: That's a key narrative heading into the speech, Arjav. Despite the President's expected claims of economic success, voter sentiment appears to be shifting. Polling data suggests growing discontent among the electorate regarding the economy, particularly concerning issues like inflation and affordability. This provides a stark contrast to the President's likely optimistic portrayal. Governor Abigail Spanberger's selection to deliver the Democratic response becomes even more strategic in this context. Her platform, which heavily focused on an affordability-first agenda, resonated deeply with voters during her 2025 gubernatorial victory. The Democrats will undoubtedly leverage this growing economic unease to underscore their own policy proposals and draw a clear distinction between their approach and that of the current administration.

HOST: So, there's a clear disconnect between the administration's narrative and public perception. And beyond that, it seems that there are cracks starting to appear within President Trump's own coalition, particularly in key battleground regions.

REPORTER: Absolutely. As the President prepares to address the nation, new reports indicate that his coalition is showing signs of fragmentation, especially in crucial areas like Northeastern Pennsylvania. This region, historically a bellwether for national elections, is currently exhibiting palpable discontent among the edges of Trump's support base. These are voters who may have backed him in previous elections but are now expressing reservations or dissatisfaction with current policies and the overall direction of the country. Simultaneously, there's an energized Democratic opposition in these very same areas, actively mobilizing and attempting to capitalize on this perceived disaffection. This dynamic suggests that the political landscape is highly volatile and that the President faces significant challenges in consolidating his base and expanding his appeal as the midterm elections loom.

HOST: This certainly complicates his agenda on multiple fronts. Looking closer at the context of the State of the Union tonight, what are the primary goals for President Trump, and what are some of the complications he's facing?

REPORTER: The prime-time address is a crucial platform for the President to directly communicate with the American public, particularly as we approach the midterm elections. His primary goal is undoubtedly to tout his record, highlighting perceived successes in areas like the economy, foreign policy, and domestic initiatives. He aims to galvanize his base and persuade undecided voters to support his party. However, his agenda is facing complications on multiple fronts. These include the previously mentioned voter skepticism regarding the economy, internal dissent within his coalition, and ongoing legislative challenges in Congress. The political environment is charged, and while the speech offers an opportunity to project strength, it also presents the challenge of addressing these underlying issues.

HOST: Now, moving beyond the SOTU itself, there's an opinion piece from The New York Times that delves into President Trump's impact on regulatory bodies. Arohi, what's the essence of this report regarding the FCC and FTC?

REPORTER: The New York Times has published an analysis arguing that Trump appointees have significantly transformed the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. The piece posits that these regulatory bodies, traditionally tasked with overseeing communications and consumer protection, have evolved into instruments of what the authors describe as "ideological enforcement" under the current administration. The implication is that policy decisions and regulatory actions by these agencies are increasingly reflecting a specific political ideology rather than solely serving their established statutory mandates. This shift, according to the analysis, has broad implications for various sectors, including media, technology, and business, and raises questions about the future of regulatory independence.

HOST: That's a significant claim about the shift in regulatory focus. Staying on economic policy, President Trump's tariff strategy has hit a snag with a recent Supreme Court ruling. What are the implications of this for global trade and the U.S. economy?

REPORTER: This Supreme Court ruling is a major development, Arjav. The Court decided that President Trump had exceeded his authority in enacting a sweeping global program of tariffs. This judgment throws his entire tariff strategy into flux. The immediate impact is that these new tariffs, which were designed to rebalance trade relationships, could now further strain already tense global trade relations. Businesses worldwide, and particularly in the U.S., are now likely to operate with increased caution, anticipating potential shifts in trade policy. This uncertainty could hurt the U.S. economy, as companies delay investments or adjust supply chains in response to the unpredictable regulatory environment. The ruling essentially challenges the administration's broad application of executive power in trade matters, forcing a re-evaluation of its approach.

HOST: So, a clear challenge to executive authority. And following that ruling, President Trump has reportedly issued threats to countries he believes are 'playing games' with existing trade deals.

REPORTER: That's correct. The President's comments came hot on the heels of the Supreme Court's decision, which, as we just discussed, found that he had overstepped his authority in implementing a wide-ranging tariff program. In response to this judicial setback, President Trump publicly threatened countries, warning them against "playing games" with existing trade agreements. This aggressive stance signals his determination to continue pursuing his protectionist trade agenda, even in the face of legal challenges and international criticism. His rhetoric suggests that while the Supreme Court may have curtailed his ability to unilaterally impose new tariffs, he remains committed to renegotiating or enforcing trade deals in a way he deems favorable to the U.S., potentially through other means or by exerting diplomatic pressure.

HOST: It's clear that trade remains a contentious issue. And this brings us to the public's understanding of these complex policies. The New York Times has been addressing common questions about the tariff regime.

REPORTER: Yes, given the ongoing developments and the Supreme Court ruling, there's a heightened public interest and, naturally, many questions surrounding President Trump’s tariff regime. The New York Times has been actively working to demystify these policies, publishing briefings specifically designed to address common concerns and clarify the implications of tariffs for consumers, businesses, and the broader economy. These efforts reflect a recognition that understanding the nuances of trade policy can be challenging, and there's a real need to explain how these decisions impact everyday life and global commerce. It’s part of a broader effort to inform the public about the financial and economic consequences of these significant policy shifts.

HOST: Despite these high-stakes developments and the President's strong rhetoric, global equity markets seem to have shrugged off the latest tariff announcement, leading to what some are calling a 'Classic TACO'. What's behind this muted investor reaction?

REPORTER: It's quite intriguing, Arjav. Despite the initial fears surrounding President Trump's latest tariff announcement, global equity markets remained largely muted. This apparent calm is being attributed to the fact that the tariffs came into effect at a lower than expected rate, specifically at ten percent. Many investors and analysts had anticipated a much higher tariff rate, which would have triggered more significant market volatility and potentially severe economic repercussions. The term "TACO," in this context, refers to a perceived "Tariff Announcement, Calm Outcome." The market's reaction suggests that the lower rate, combined with perhaps some degree of 'tariff fatigue' or a belief that the administration might be tempering its approach, led investors to largely shrug off the news, indicating that the immediate economic impact is not as dire as initially projected.

HOST: That's a fascinating interpretation of market behavior. Beyond trade, there are broader economic anxieties brewing. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a stark warning, stating his anxiety is high regarding lofty asset prices and other economic risks. What specifically is he concerned about?

REPORTER: Jamie Dimon, a highly influential voice in the financial world, has indeed raised a red flag, urging people to "watch out" as he expressed high levels of anxiety over the current economic climate. His concerns stem from a confluence of factors. Primarily, he points to what he sees as lofty asset prices, suggesting that valuations across various markets might be inflated and potentially unsustainable. This situation, he believes, is colliding with increased competition among lenders, which could put pressure on profit margins and introduce instability. Additionally, he highlighted jitters over loans specifically within the software industry, an area that has seen rapid growth and substantial investment but could be vulnerable to market shifts. Dimon’s warning is a caution about potential underlying vulnerabilities in the financial system.

HOST: Very sobering insights from one of the titans of finance. Shifting gears to corporate taxation, the IRS is reportedly opening a new front in its fight against big companies, specifically targeting Meta. What tactics are they employing?

REPORTER: This is a significant development in the ongoing battle over corporate tax avoidance, Arjav. The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, is deploying new and aggressive tactics against major corporations, with Meta, formerly Facebook, being a prime example. The agency is now using real-world profit data to challenge how these large companies value their offshore intellectual property. Traditionally, multinational corporations have moved intellectual property like patents and trademarks to lower-tax jurisdictions, assigning them a certain value. The IRS is now scrutinizing these valuations much more closely, using the actual profits generated by these assets globally to argue that they were undervalued when moved offshore. This strategy aims to ensure that profits generated from U.S.-developed IP are taxed appropriately within the U.S., potentially leading to substantial new tax liabilities for tech giants and other large firms.

HOST: That's a big move from the IRS, certainly one to watch. And speaking of economic shifts, we've seen a significant dip in markets recently. Reports indicate a market crash of a thousand points, driven by rising US-Iran tensions and trade uncertainties.

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. Global markets, including major indices, experienced a significant downturn, with some markets crashing over a thousand points. This sharp decline is largely being attributed to a combination of escalating US-Iran tensions and lingering uncertainties surrounding global trade policies. Geopolitical instability in the Middle East often sends shockwaves through financial markets, particularly impacting oil prices and investor confidence. Additionally, the ongoing trade disputes, despite the recent muted reaction to some tariffs, continue to cast a shadow of unpredictability over international commerce, making investors wary. Tech stocks, which have seen significant growth, were particularly hit hard during this downturn, dragging down overall market performance and underscoring the interconnectedness of geopolitical events and economic health.

HOST: A volatile period for global markets, indeed. Let's turn our attention now to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where Russia's economy appears to be fundamentally remaking itself for war, potentially at great long-term risk. What are the details there?

REPORTER: This is a critical point, Arjav. Reports indicate that Russia is dedicating an astonishing amount of its federal budget—roughly half—directly toward the fight in Ukraine. While this massive allocation allows Moscow to sustain its military efforts in the short term, it's raising serious concerns about the country's long-term economic development. Money channeled into military spending does little to foster innovation, improve infrastructure, or invest in human capital, all of which are vital for sustainable growth. By prioritizing war expenditures to such an extent, Russia is essentially mortgaging its future, diverting resources from sectors that could drive economic diversification and stability. This strategy, while enabling its military campaign, puts the nation's future economic health and potential for prosperity at significant risk.

HOST: That's a sobering assessment of Russia's economic trajectory. Amidst this, diplomatic efforts continue, however challenging. A Ukrainian negotiator has shared insights into what it feels like to sit across the table from Russia.

REPORTER: Sergiy Kyslytsya, a prominent Ukrainian diplomat, has offered a candid perspective on the grueling and emotionally taxing process of negotiating with Russia. His account highlights the immense psychological burden and the stark contrast in perspectives when representatives from the two warring nations meet. He emphasized the profound sense of responsibility, the difficulty of finding common ground amidst deep-seated animosity, and the sheer challenge of maintaining composure while discussing an end to a conflict that has entered its fifth year. His insights underscore the human element behind these high-stakes diplomatic endeavors, revealing the personal toll these negotiations take on those striving for peace in an incredibly difficult environment.

HOST: It certainly sounds like an immense emotional and professional challenge. And some horrific accounts are emerging directly from the Russian side of the front lines. Russian soldiers are reportedly describing killings of troops who refuse orders.

REPORTER: That's correct, Arjav. Disturbing accounts from Russian soldiers who are reportedly on the run have surfaced, detailing the horrors they witnessed on the front lines in Ukraine. These men describe a ruthless environment where, according to their testimonies, anyone who attempts to retreat or refuses to follow orders is summarily shot. These firsthand accounts paint a grim picture of military discipline enforced through extreme violence and coercion, highlighting potential war crimes and severe human rights abuses within the Russian ranks. Such reports, if substantiated, underscore the brutal realities of the conflict and the profound desperation of some soldiers caught within its machinery.

HOST: Those are truly chilling accounts, highlighting the human cost of this conflict. And from the front lines in Ukraine, we also have reports of an explosion closer to home, within Russia itself. Russian officials are attributing a Moscow rail hub explosion to a suicide bomb.

REPORTER: Yes, Russian officials have confirmed that an explosion at a Moscow rail hub was the result of a suicide bombing. The incident tragically resulted in the deaths of both a traffic police officer and the suspect involved. While details remain somewhat limited, authorities have launched a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the blast. This event introduces a new layer of concern regarding internal security within Russia, particularly given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The official attribution of the explosion to a suicide bomb suggests a possible act of terrorism, raising questions about motives and potential broader implications for public safety in the capital city.

HOST: A disturbing incident in Moscow. Now, let's move to Mexico, where there's been recent unrest. The BBC's Will Grant has been reporting on the atmosphere there following a wave of violence. What's the situation like?

REPORTER: The BBC's Will Grant has provided a vivid description of the atmosphere in Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, Mexico, following a recent wave of violence that hit its streets. According to his report, locals are understandably feeling a mixture of apprehension and resilience. The unrest, which included blockades and clashes, caused significant disruption and fear. While the immediate violence may have subsided, the lingering effects on public sentiment are palpable. Residents are navigating a challenging environment, grappling with concerns about safety and security, even as they attempt to return to a sense of normalcy. Grant's observations underscore the profound impact that such outbreaks of violence have on daily life and the collective psyche of a community.

HOST: Thank you for that update from Mexico, Arohi. Finally, a notable political development from Europe: Rob Jetten has become the Netherlands' youngest ever Prime Minister.

REPORTER: That's correct, Arjav. At just 38 years old, Rob Jetten has been officially sworn in as the Netherlands' new prime minister, making him the youngest person ever to hold that office in the country's history. His ascension to the premiership comes after he successfully clinched a narrow victory in October's general election. Jetten, known for his progressive stance and focus on climate policy, represents a new generation of political leadership for the Netherlands. His appointment signals a significant generational shift in Dutch politics and will be watched closely as he navigates the complex political and economic landscape of the European Union.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive reports and insights today. Always a pleasure.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And that wraps up our News Briefing for today. Before we go, here's a surprising fact for you: The world's quietest room, located at Microsoft's headquarters, is so silent that the background noise level measures an astonishing -20.35 dBA, which is 20 decibels below the threshold of human hearing. It's so quiet, in fact, that most people can hear their own blood flowing when inside.

HOST: That's all for now. Join us again tomorrow for more essential news and analysis. Have a fantastic day!
