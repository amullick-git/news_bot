But if you're outside the field, I'm interested to know if you can still solve it with browser use LLMs, and if you learned something interesting doing so. Let me know what you think.<p>I made it with Claude over the last 2 months. My coding experience is limited to basic python data analysis and figure making. I've seen people online asking, \"Now that we have coding AI, why isn't there a deluge of awesome AI-generated apps made by non-coders?\" - if this sounds like you, check out Geneguessr to understand what a web app by a non-coder looks like.<p>I might write more about the process if there's a demand, but what really unlocked the project for Claude was Linear MCP, where it could put each individual issue on a shared Kanban board. This, and Playwright MCP for testing on live site, were the two workhorses that got me through this. For bugs Claude couldn't one-shot, Linear was great for consolidating issue information so that I could dump it into ChatGPT Codex - it would usually think for like half an hour, output very confusing explanations, but the bug was gone.<p>Game is free, no log-in required, sorry if you run into any mobile bugs - didn't test it much there.<p><a href=\"https://geneguessr.brinedew.bio/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://geneguessr.brinedew.bio/</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46363870\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46363870</a></p>\n<p>Points: 60</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>",
