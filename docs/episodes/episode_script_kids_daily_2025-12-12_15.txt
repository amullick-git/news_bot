HOST: Good Afternoon, future innovators and curious minds! Welcome to Kids News, your daily dive into the most exciting stories from around the world of science, technology, and beyond! I'm Arjav, and today, we've got stellar news from space and groundbreaking developments right here on Earth, especially in Artificial Intelligence.

HOST: But first, an "On This Day in History" fact! Did you know that on December 12, 1962, NASA launched Relay 1? This was the first communications satellite for TV and phone signals across the Atlantic Ocean! Relay 1 connected the world like never before, laying groundwork for how we communicate today. Pretty cool, right?

HOST: Joining us today to break down these big stories into bite-sized, easy-to-understand pieces is our fantastic reporter, Arohi!

REPORTER: Thanks, Arjav! Always a blast to be here with exciting news.

HOST: Let's jump right into the cosmic wonders first. NASA has been making huge waves in space exploration. We're hearing that two of their amazing inventions, the James Webb Space Telescope and the Curiosity rover, have been honored in TIME magazine’s “Best Inventions Hall of Fame.” What makes these two so special?

REPORTER: It is a huge deal! Imagine TIME recognizing the 25 most impactful inventions of the past quarter century. The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, is a super-powerful eye in space. It sees incredibly far away, even back to when first stars and galaxies formed, using infrared light our eyes can’t see. It helps us understand our universe's beginning.

REPORTER: And the Curiosity rover? Think of it as a science lab on Mars! It landed in 2012, driving, taking pictures, and analyzing rocks to find out if Mars ever had conditions for tiny life. Both give us incredible new knowledge about space and our place in it. They truly earned their spot.

HOST: Wow, a super eye in space and a robotic science lab on Mars! It's incredible what we can achieve. And speaking of amazing people at NASA, we also heard that astronaut Jonny Kim is going to be discussing his recent mission aboard the International Space Station. What can you tell us about Jonny Kim and his time in space?

REPORTER: Jonny Kim is a truly remarkable person. He’s not just an astronaut; he’s also a Navy SEAL and a doctor, and he’s spent eight months living and working on the International Space Station, or ISS! The ISS is a gigantic orbiting laboratory where astronauts from different countries live and conduct scientific experiments in microgravity – that's what we call it when things feel weightless in space.

REPORTER: During his mission, Jonny Kim participated in all sorts of important research, from studying how the human body adapts to space to testing new technologies. He’ll be sharing his experiences, what it’s like to live away from Earth for so long, and what discoveries they made. It's a fantastic chance to hear directly from someone who's been to space!

HOST: Eight months in space – I can only imagine the incredible stories he has. Now, looking ahead, NASA isn't just celebrating past achievements; they’re also planning some exciting new missions. What's this about a plan to map the Milky Way with the Roman Space Telescope?

REPORTER: This is incredibly exciting! Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is a huge spiral of billions of stars and planets. We still haven't mapped parts in detail. That’s where the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope comes in.

REPORTER: This new telescope sees a very wide area of space at once. NASA plans a special "Galactic Plane Survey," like taking a super-detailed photo of our entire galaxy! Over just one month of observations spread across two years, it will reveal tens of billions of stars and discover structures we've never seen, changing our understanding of the Milky Way.

HOST: Mapping our entire galaxy sounds like a monumental task! It's amazing to think about what we might uncover. And speaking of looking at other galaxies, we have a fascinating image from the Hubble Space Telescope featuring a glittering blue dwarf galaxy called Markarian 178. What makes this galaxy so interesting?

REPORTER: The Hubble Space Telescope is another of NASA’s fantastic "eyes" in space. This image of Markarian 178, or Mrk 178, shows a "dwarf galaxy." Imagine our Milky Way as a giant city; a dwarf galaxy is like a small town, much smaller than our own.

REPORTER: Mrk 178 is special because it's a "star-forming galaxy," meaning lots of new, very bright stars are being born there. It's also 13 million light-years away. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year. So, the light from Mrk 178 we see today left that galaxy 13 million years ago! These images help scientists understand how galaxies form and evolve.

HOST: Thirteen million light-years, that’s almost mind-boggling! It’s like a time machine! And we have one more incredible image from Hubble, this time of something called the Calabash Nebula, showing what’s described as the death of a low-mass star. Can you explain what a nebula is and what's happening in this picture?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. A nebula is a giant cloud of gas and dust in space. They are often where new stars are born, but sometimes they form when a star dies. In this image, a low-mass star – like our Sun – transforms rapidly.

REPORTER: When such a star runs out of fuel, it expands into a "red giant." Then, it blows off its outer layers of gas and dust into space, creating beautiful, complex shapes we call a "planetary nebula." The Calabash Nebula shows this process happening, forming a kind of hourglass shape. It’s a rare glimpse into the end of a star’s life cycle.

HOST: Wow, from the birth of galaxies to the death of stars, space is truly full of incredible wonders. Thank you for those amazing updates, Arohi! Now, let’s bring our focus back down to Earth, specifically to the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence, or AI. It seems like AI is everywhere these days, and there's a lot of buzz around companies like OpenAI and Google. Can you help us understand what AI is and why these companies are in a big competition?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is when computers are programmed to think and learn like humans. They can solve problems, understand language, recognize images, and even create. Think of it like teaching a computer to have a brain!

REPORTER: Companies like OpenAI and Google develop incredibly smart AI systems. They constantly try to make their AI more powerful and helpful. This is why you see competition; OpenAI recently released technology designed to be more advanced than Google's. It’s a race to build the smartest AI, impacting how we live and work.

HOST: So, it's like a technology Olympics for smart computers! And we've also heard about a company called Rivian, an electric vehicle maker, impressing Wall Street with its AI plans. How does AI fit into electric cars?

REPORTER: That’s a great question! For Rivian, an electric truck and SUV maker, AI helps in automation and self-driving. Automation uses AI to make manufacturing efficient. For self-driving, AI is the brain for the car to "see" the road, understand traffic, and make decisions. Rivian uses AI to make vehicles smarter and safer, which impresses investors.

HOST: It's amazing how AI can make everything from factories to cars smarter. Now, with all this powerful AI developing, there's also a big discussion about how it should be regulated. We're seeing news about President Donald Trump signing an executive order regarding a national AI framework. What exactly is an executive order, and what does this mean for AI regulation?

REPORTER: An executive order is instructions from the President to parts of the government. President Trump’s order aims to create a for AI regulation across the U.S.

REPORTER: The order suggests states shouldn't make AI laws if they're too difficult for AI companies. It's an effort to keep AI rules consistent, which big tech companies often favor as it simplifies operations.

HOST: So, the idea is to have one rulebook for AI across the whole country, instead of many different ones. And speaking of AI, it seems to be helping us in unexpected ways, even with holiday shopping! We’re hearing that AI tools like chatbots could drive billions in holiday sales. How is AI making holiday shopping easier or more fun?

REPORTER: This is a practical use of AI! Many people use AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, for holiday shopping. It’s like having a super-smart personal assistant.

REPORTER: You can ask a chatbot for gift ideas, product reviews, or to compare prices. It helps people find the best deals and perfect presents, boosting sales for stores.

HOST: That sounds incredibly helpful for finding the perfect gift and saving some money too! Now, let’s shift gears to a different kind of regulation, this time about kids and social media. Australia has recently made news for banning kids under a certain age from social media platforms, and companies like Reddit are challenging it. What's happening there?

REPORTER: This is a really important global discussion, Arjav. Australia has introduced a policy banning children under 16 from social media. The idea is to protect younger kids from online harms like cyberbullying or mental health issues.

REPORTER: Companies like Reddit challenge this in Australia's High Court, arguing it impacts privacy and political rights. They believe younger people have a right to online access and expression, seeing a blanket ban as too restrictive.

HOST: That's a really challenging balancing act for governments. And this isn’t the only time we’ve heard about tech companies clashing with regulators. Elon Musk, the owner of social media platform X, has also been making headlines, reportedly clashing with the European Union over its online laws. What’s going on there?

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. Europe has strict online laws, especially regulating social media content and protecting user data. These laws aim to make platforms safer and more accountable.

REPORTER: Elon Musk’s platform X was fined by the European Union for not following rules on handling harmful content. Musk has pushed back, arguing it restricts free speech. This highlights tension between tech companies and governments on internet rules.

HOST: It certainly sounds like the world of technology and regulation is constantly changing. From the vastness of space to the debates around AI and social media, there’s always something new to learn! Arohi, thank you so much for breaking down these complex stories for us today. Your explanations make everything so clear and exciting!

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav! Always happy to share the latest news with our amazing listeners.

HOST: And that’s all the time we have for Kids News today! Before we go, here’s a fascinating fun fact: Did you know the entire internet, if you could store all its data physically, would weigh less than a single strawberry? That’s because the internet is information carried by tiny electrons and light pulses! It’s all about bits, not heavy objects!

HOST: Thanks for tuning in, everyone! Keep exploring, keep learning, and remember to always stay curious. We’ll catch you next time for more amazing stories from our incredible world. Goodbye for now!
