HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing, your daily dive into the headlines. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, bringing you the latest stories from BBC News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many more trusted sources.

HOST: Arohi, before we jump into today's top stories, let's start with an interesting moment from history. On this day, January 2nd, in 1890, Alice Sanger became the first woman to be hired as a staffer in the White House, serving President Benjamin Harrison's administration. A quiet but significant step in American political history.

REPORTER: A fascinating start, Arjav! Now, turning to our first major story, the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein continues to generate significant public interest and, as expected, numerous questions.

HOST: Indeed, it's a situation ripe for speculation. What's the latest on these files and their impact?

REPORTER: Well, the Justice Department's piecemeal release of information, coupled with President Trump's evolving statements, has done little to quell the public's demand for clarity. Despite the initial releases, many key questions persist about who knew what, when, and the extent of involvement of high-profile individuals. Conspiracy theories are flourishing in the vacuum of complete information, highlighting the public's distrust and the perceived lack of transparency surrounding the case. Congress has also made unprecedented demands for full disclosure, indicating the political pressure to resolve these lingering mysteries.

HOST: A complex and sensitive situation. Staying on the topic of former President Trump, he recently issued a strong statement regarding the Jan. 6th Capitol events.

REPORTER: That's right. Trump has been termed "the Jan. 6 President" by some commentators, arguing that America continues to operate within a political era significantly shaped by the events of January 6th, 2021. This perspective suggests that the political divides and the narratives surrounding the incident continue to influence national discourse and policy.

HOST: And shifting gears slightly to domestic policy, there's also talk about Trump's potential role in the Affordable Care Act subsidies.

REPORTER: Exactly. While much of the focus is on other issues, some analysts are discussing how a move by former President Trump could actually play a role in extending ACA subsidies. It's a surprising turn given his past stance on the Affordable Care Act, but it speaks to the evolving landscape of healthcare policy.

HOST: Fascinating. And on another domestic front, we're hearing about threats to Somali-run daycare centers in Minnesota. What's behind that?

REPORTER: Unfortunately, these centers have reported receiving threats following a viral video that accused them of fraud. It's a serious concern for these community-based businesses and highlights underlying social tensions. Authorities are investigating the origins and nature of these threats, aiming to ensure the safety and security of these vital community services.

HOST: A concerning development indeed. Now, let's turn our attention to international affairs, specifically the escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Arohi, President Trump has made a very direct statement regarding the ongoing protests in Iran.

REPORTER: Yes, he has. President Trump warned that the U.S. would intervene if Iran "violently kills" protesters, stating "we will come to their rescue." This came after days of demonstrations and clashes in Iran, which initially erupted over the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices.

HOST: And how has Iran reacted to this warning?

REPORTER: As expected, Iran has strongly warned the U.S. to stay out of its internal affairs. Iranian officials have alleged that the U.S. and Israel are actively stoking these sweeping protests. They went further, stating that U.S. military bases in the region would be considered legitimate targets if Washington intervenes. This has significantly heightened the already tense diplomatic situation.

HOST: This isn't the first time the U.S. has considered or undertaken interventions in other nations, particularly in Latin America.

REPORTER: That's correct, Arjav. President Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuela is just the latest chapter in a long history of U.S. intervention in the region, a policy largely rooted in the 1823 Monroe Doctrine. This history is a mixed bag of both successes and failures, with interventions often having unforeseen and complex long-term consequences for the region. It provides important context for understanding current U.S. foreign policy discussions.

HOST: And speaking of Venezuela, we've also got news about an oil tanker fleeing the U.S. Coast Guard.

REPORTER: Yes, a rather dramatic development. An oil tanker, previously intercepted in the Caribbean on its way to pick up oil in Venezuela, has reportedly broadcast its location in the North Atlantic while fleeing the U.S. Coast Guard. Russia this week explicitly requested that the United States end its pursuit of the vessel. This incident underscores the complexities of international maritime law and geopolitical tensions surrounding oil trade and sanctions.

HOST: A truly intricate situation unfolding on the high seas. From international geopolitics, let's bring it back to local U.S. politics, specifically New York City, where Mayor Mamdani has just taken office. Arohi, what are the key challenges facing the new Democratic Socialist mayor?

REPORTER: Mayor Zohran Mamdani faces four significant challenges as he steps into office. The primary question is whether this Democratic Socialist can deliver on the ambitious cost-of-living promises that were central to his successful campaign. These include tackling affordable housing, public transportation, and income inequality, all within the complex financial and political landscape of New York City.

HOST: And how was his victory celebrated by his supporters?

REPORTER: Democratic Socialists celebrated Mayor Mamdani's inauguration with a unique event: a rave in a Bushwick dance club. It was a vibrant gathering where supporters cheered as one of their members began his term governing New York City, marking a significant moment for the progressive movement in urban politics.

HOST: It certainly sounds like a distinct way to mark a new political era. And what's one of his first official initiatives?

REPORTER: One of Mayor Mamdani's first actions has been to create an Office to Encourage Public Participation in Government. He expressed his hope that this new office would help reach communities that have historically been left out of the political process, aiming to foster greater civic engagement and inclusivity across the city.

HOST: A promising start for community involvement. Now, let's shift to the world of business and finance. Arohi, the stock market in 2026 is showing some familiar patterns from last year.

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. The 2026 stock market is looking remarkably similar to the bifurcated market of 2025. A closer look inside the S&P 500 reveals a major division: five sectors are performing higher, with industrials leading the charge, while six sectors are lower, primarily led by consumer discretionary. This indicates a selective growth environment rather than a broad market rally.

HOST: And within that landscape, which city's market stood out in 2025?

REPORTER: According to CNBC's exclusive Power City Indexes, Charlotte, often called the 'Queen City,' was the unexpected king of the stock market in 2025. Interestingly, it wasn't the tech giants or A.I. that propelled its success, but rather sectors like lithium and steel that outshined them, highlighting a diverse set of economic drivers.

HOST: An interesting regional success story. And speaking of market titans, what's the latest with Berkshire Hathaway?

REPORTER: Berkshire Hathaway shares have seen a dip as investors digest the formal end of Warren Buffett's six-decade tenure as chief executive. This marks the beginning of a new era under his successor, Greg Abel. The market is naturally reacting to such a monumental leadership transition at one of the world's most prominent holding companies.

HOST: A true changing of the guard there. And finally, some news from the retail sector. Saks is seeing a leadership change.

REPORTER: Indeed. Saks C.E.O. Marc Metrick has stepped down amidst the company's struggles to pay down debt. Richard Baker, the executive chairman of Saks Global, who created the luxury retailer with the 2024 acquisition of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, is now taking over the helm. This move underscores the ongoing challenges in the luxury retail market.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive updates. That's a wrap on today's Quick News Briefing.
