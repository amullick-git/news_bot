HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing, your daily dive into the headlines that shape our world. I'm Arjav.

HOST: On this day in history, January 8th, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson delivered his famous "Fourteen Points" speech to a joint session of Congress, outlining his vision for peace after World War I. A significant moment in shaping international relations, echoing today's global landscape where diplomatic strategies are constantly under scrutiny.

HOST: We’re tracking major stories from BBC News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many more, bringing you the most important developments. Joining me as always is our lead reporter, Arohi. Arohi, a lot to unpack today, starting with some significant developments out of Venezuela.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. The big news is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, which led to the capture of Nicolás Maduro. This move marks a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, essentially sidelining the traditional Venezuelan opposition that the U.S. previously supported. The atmosphere there is described as very authoritarian, and the opposition is now reeling from the sidelines, struggling to define its next steps after President Trump's decisive, unilateral action. This follows a period where Mr. Trump had been working with remnants of Maduro's regime, a controversial approach.

HOST: That's a stunning development. And this isn't just about Venezuela, is it? It seems to reflect a broader philosophy from the White House regarding presidential power.

REPORTER: Precisely. A recent interview with President Trump in The New York Times laid this bare. He made it clear, on topic after topic, that he views himself as the ultimate arbiter of any limits to his authorities. This isn't just about foreign policy or international law; it's a comprehensive assertion of executive power, pushing against traditional boundaries and treaties.

HOST: And this stance is creating ripples even within his own party here at home. We saw some significant Republican defections on a war powers vote tied to Venezuela.

REPORTER: Yes, indeed. Five Republican senators broke with the President, joining Democrats to pave the way for a debate on Venezuela war powers. This was a direct challenge to the administration's actions and signaled bipartisan concern about the President's authority in military engagements. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Trump lashed out, urging voters to oust these Republicans, specifically calling for them to lose their seats, including the politically endangered Senator Susan Collins.

HOST: A clear message there from the President to his party. This assertion of presidential authority also seems to be extending to domestic institutions, specifically the Justice Department.

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. A concerning announcement came from JD Vance, who stated that a new Justice Department fraud post would be "run out of the White House." This is seen as a brazen effort to bypass the traditional separation between the White House and federal law enforcement investigations, a move that critics argue further erodes institutional independence.

HOST: And globally, there's also news about the U.S. withdrawing from several international organizations. How does that fit into this picture?

REPORTER: It's another piece of the puzzle, Arjav. The Trump administration is pulling out of 31 United Nations groups and a total of 66 global organizations. These include entities focused on critical issues like climate and global health. This broad withdrawal signals a deep skepticism toward multilateralism and reinforces the administration's preference for unilateral action, again emphasizing a singular view of national interest above international cooperation.

HOST: And speaking of executive influence, the President recently had a meeting with the CEO of Intel. What came out of that?

REPORTER: President Trump posted on Truth Social about meeting with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. He applauded the company for launching a processor in the U.S. and touted its success, which subsequently saw Intel stock rise. This highlights the administration's engagement with major corporations and its focus on domestic manufacturing and technological innovation.

HOST: Shifting gears slightly, another area where President Trump has expressed unconventional interest is Greenland. What's the latest there?

REPORTER: This topic has resurfaced, Arjav, especially since the Venezuela intervention. President Trump has reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland, reportedly for trillions if it were for sale. While Denmark has firmly stated it's not for sale, the U.S. is reportedly considering significant investments in critical minerals mining there. The CEO of Amaroq, a mining firm, told CNBC that talks, though not finalized, could involve off-take agreements, infrastructure support, and credit lines, indicating serious U.S. interest in Greenland’s strategic resources, even without an outright purchase.

HOST: So, beyond ownership, the U.S. is looking at securing access to those vital resources. Let's turn to a somber story developing domestically. There's been a fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis.

REPORTER: This is a very serious situation, Arjav. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning. This incident has sparked grief and outrage, leading to growing protests in cities across the country. In response to the unrest, Minnesota's governor activated the state's National Guard, and a hundred more federal agents were also deployed to Minneapolis as the U.S. takes over the shooting investigation.

HOST: A tense situation that continues to unfold. From Earth-bound concerns to space, Nasa is facing a medical issue on the International Space Station. What can you tell us about that?

REPORTER: Nasa is currently assessing its next steps following a medical issue involving a crew member aboard the International Space Station. The details are sparse, but the agency is determining whether to bring the sick crew member back to Earth, a complex decision given the inherent risks and logistical challenges of space travel and re-entry.

HOST: A critical situation requiring careful evaluation. And briefly, on a health-related note, CNBC's Becky Quick has started a new initiative.

REPORTER: Yes, Squawk Box anchor Becky Quick has launched CNBC Cures, inspired by her daughter's journey with a rare disease. She's detailing her personal story to raise awareness and support for rare disease research.

HOST: Finally, back to domestic politics for a moment. Governor Gavin Newsom delivered his State of the State address.

REPORTER: Governor Newsom used his State of the State address to directly criticize President Trump. He portrayed California as a "beacon of democracy," setting the state apart from federal policies. His speech also suggested broader national ambitions, positioning California as a progressive counterpoint to the current federal administration.

HOST: That's all the time we have for the news headlines today. Before we go, here's a surprising fact: Did you know that the internet, a critical tool for global communication today, transfers so much data that if you were to print out all the information that travels across it in a single day, the stack of paper would be tall enough to reach the moon and back over 20 times? A staggering thought when we consider the digital age.

HOST: Thank you for joining us on Quick News Briefing. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And we appreciate you tuning in. We'll be back tomorrow with more.

HOST: Good night.
