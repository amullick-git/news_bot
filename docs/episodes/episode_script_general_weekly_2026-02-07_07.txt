HOST: Good Morning! Welcome to Weekly News Round-up! I'm Arjav.

On this day in history, February 4th, 2004, a platform called "Thefacebook" was launched from a Harvard dorm room. This seemingly simple creation would fundamentally change how we connect online, paving the way for the intricate digital social landscape we navigate today. Two decades later, technology, especially artificial intelligence, continues to reshape our world at an unprecedented pace, prompting both excitement and new challenges.

Joining me, as always, is our brilliant reporter, Arohi, to break down the week's most significant developments. We're covering everything from the latest in AI innovation and the global economy to crucial international and domestic stories, drawing insights from BBC News, ESPN Cricinfo.com, Hacker News, NDTV News, The New York Times, and CNBC, among other trusted sources. Arohi, let's dive straight into the rapidly evolving world of AI. What's caught your attention this week?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. Artificial intelligence is certainly leading the charge in many sectors, showcasing its growing impact across industries. We've seen Palantir, the data analytics giant, significantly outperform Wall Street's fourth-quarter estimates. This robust performance is largely attributed to surging demand for its AI tools, particularly as more businesses and the U.S. government race to buy its advanced artificial intelligence solutions, highlighting AI's increasing integration into crucial defense and enterprise applications.

HOST: That's a strong indication of AI's commercial power. And it seems the innovation isn't slowing down, with new models continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

REPORTER: Indeed. Anthropic just launched its latest AI model, Claude Opus 4.6. This new iteration is designed to be better at coding, sustaining tasks for longer, and creating high-quality professional work, signaling a shift towards what some are calling a 'vibe working' era where AI handles more complex, long-term assignments. Major tech players are also deeply invested in this AI race. Amazon’s cloud unit, AWS, reported strong revenue and profit, largely fueled by its aggressive investments to capitalize on artificial intelligence opportunities in the cloud sector. Similarly, Starbucks is looking to AI and robotics to brew a turnaround in customer experience, with Chief Executive Brian Niccol explaining how he thinks AI will help the coffee giant regain its buzz. Globally, China is also making its move, aiming to lead the world in developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence. However, Beijing is emphasizing a dual approach, pushing for innovation while also implementing an increasingly complex set of rules and regulations for companies to adhere to, signaling a controlled yet ambitious trajectory for AI development.

HOST: It sounds like the industry is not just building new AI, but also rigorously testing and assessing its capabilities and, importantly, its vulnerabilities.

REPORTER: Precisely. We're seeing a concentrated effort to benchmark and test AI models. Qodo.ai, for example, has developed a real-world benchmark for AI code review, indicating a push for practical, measurable performance in software development. Google DeepMind is advancing AI benchmarking with its Game Arena, using competitive gaming environments to evaluate AI agents in complex scenarios. On the security front, a creator developed "Agent Arena," a platform specifically designed to test how manipulation-proof AI agents are. This tool sends AI agents to a seemingly harmless web page loaded with ten hidden prompt injection attacks – including HTML comments, white-on-white text, zero-width Unicode, and data attributes. The findings are quite telling: basic attacks succeed about 70% of the time, and even hardened agents struggle with multi-layer attacks. Only about 15% of agents tested achieve a perfect score, highlighting a critical area for improvement given the growing autonomy of AI agents online.

HOST: And speaking of online interaction, it appears AI is now even getting its own social networks. This is quite a fascinating development.

REPORTER: That's right, and it's certainly capturing attention. A new social media platform called Moltbook has emerged, designed exclusively for AI bots. This new message board for artificial intelligence agents has prompted some strange conversations and existential questions about the inner lives of bots, quickly becoming the talk of Silicon Valley and acting as a Rorschach test for belief in the current state of artificial intelligence. The sheer novelty and the philosophical implications are significant. And, as AI becomes more pervasive, tech giants are also looking to influence its public perception and adoption. Google and Microsoft, for instance, are offering lucrative deals, with some offers upwards of half a million dollars, to influencers to promote their AI products. This aggressive marketing push highlights a significant effort to shape public opinion and accelerate the widespread adoption of AI technologies.

HOST: An intriguing glimpse into the future, both in terms of AI development and its societal integration. Now, let's pivot to some critical domestic news here in the U.S. Arohi, what are the top stories this week impacting the nation?

REPORTER: Shifting focus domestically, there are several key developments. The U.S. and Iran are reportedly set to hold talks regarding Iran's nuclear program, a significant development that will undoubtedly be closely watched on the international stage. Domestically, Congress continues its intense debate on immigration enforcement changes, with a crucial funding deadline looming, bringing significant pressure on lawmakers to reach a resolution on this contentious issue. The FBI is also actively examining ransom notes as part of its ongoing search for Nancy Guthrie, a case that has captured national attention and sparked concerns about public safety. These national stories also intertwine with local impacts, particularly in Minneapolis, which has faced its own set of challenges.

HOST: Minneapolis has certainly been in the headlines recently, especially concerning the presence of immigration agents. How are businesses there coping with this prolonged crisis?

REPORTER: It's a challenging situation that local businesses are navigating with remarkable resilience. Small business owners in Minneapolis and St. Paul are working tirelessly to lift up a community that has been significantly roiled by the presence of thousands of immigration agents. They describe the current environment as "this is our new normal," indicating the deep and lasting impact on daily life and commerce, yet they remain committed to supporting their community through the uncertainty. This very situation in Minneapolis has also highlighted a broader, pervasive issue in our digital age: the internet's battle with truth. The chaos observed there has exposed how technological advances and an erosion of trust have transformed the way news unfolds online, distorting shared reality through the rapid spread of disinformation and misinformation.

HOST: That's a profound observation about our current information ecosystem and the challenges facing communities. And speaking of information, we've also seen significant shifts and pressures within the media industry itself, particularly with one prominent national newspaper.

REPORTER: Indeed, the Washington Post has been making headlines for its significant internal restructuring and deep job cuts. Owner Jeff Bezos has ordered these severe reductions, despite appeals from the newsroom to reconsider. The paper is narrowing its editorial focus, announcing it will concentrate largely on politics and national security, a strategic pivot that comes with substantial workforce reductions. This includes the highly impactful elimination of its entire sports department, with all reporters and editors in that section either being laid off or reassigned, a decision made just days before major national and international events like the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics in Italy. These sweeping layoffs are slated to shrink the newsroom by hundreds of journalists, cutting deeply into The Post’s local, international, and especially sports coverage.

HOST: A stark change for a storied institution, reflecting broader pressures on the news industry to adapt to evolving economic and reader demands. Now, let's turn our attention to India, which has been quite active on the international trade and economic fronts this week.

REPORTER: India has certainly been proactive in its economic diplomacy. Prime Minister Modi has publicly thanked President Trump for his personal commitment to a new India-U.S. trade deal. This agreement, which establishes a uniform rate, is seen as giving India a competitive edge over several countries in its neighborhood and the wider region, signaling a strengthening of bilateral economic ties and potentially boosting its export capabilities. The immediate market reaction to this news was notably positive, with the Indian stock market widely expected to jump significantly following the announcement of this landmark India-U.S. trade deal.

HOST: Beyond that specific deal, what's India's broader economic strategy, particularly as global tensions continue to rise?

REPORTER: India is strategically looking for what it calls "faraway friendships." Squeezed between geopolitical and economic dynamics with the U.S. and China, India is overcoming its traditional aversion to free-trade deals to cozy up with Canada and other middle powers. This reflects a pragmatic approach to securing its economic interests and diversifying its trade relationships in a complex global landscape. Domestically, India’s budget for 2026 is focusing heavily on long-term, unglamorous work. It emphasizes significant infrastructure and defense spending, alongside tax breaks specifically for data center investments, pushing to foster local industry, particularly in critical areas like rare earths, amidst rising global tensions. The budget has been characterized by some as prioritizing economic enhancement to realize the audacious ambition of becoming a developed economy in the next 21 years, shunning "instant gratification" for sustained growth. Despite an initial budget day crash in the markets, the Prime Minister's economic advisor, Sanjeev Sanyal, described the budget as a "workman like" exercise and brushed off the market fluctuations as a normal "up and down" cycle. However, some top market advisors, like Dharmesh Mehta, have expressed concern that foreign institutional investors, or FIIs, have not been treated well, noting that FIIs are still net negative by approximately 38,000 crore rupees, which is a significant figure reflecting continued capital outflow.

HOST: It seems India is also keen on becoming a major player in the AI space, much like other global powers we discussed earlier.

REPORTER: Absolutely. India is actively fostering its AI ecosystem with significant initiatives. The India AI Impact Summit 2026 has drawn a strong international response, receiving an impressive 250 submissions and attracting 100 CEOs and top AI minds from around the world. This indicates a serious commitment to advancing AI research and innovation within the country, aiming to carve out a significant and competitive role in the global artificial intelligence landscape.

HOST: From national economies to global markets, let's briefly touch on some broader economic trends before we turn to sports. There's been some interesting and perhaps concerning movement in the commodities market this week.

REPORTER: Yes, indeed. Silver has garnered significant attention in financial circles, experiencing a rapid surge followed by an equally dramatic reversal. This extreme volatility has ignited questions among investors: when does an asset start behaving like a "meme trade," reminiscent of GameStop in 2026? It highlights the increasingly unpredictable nature of modern markets, often influenced by social media sentiment and the collective actions of retail investors. This phenomenon, along with other unusual market behaviors, suggests that the global economy’s usual warning signals might be broken. Traditionally reliable indicators, from market performance to consumer spending and national debt, that typically forecast where the economy is headed are proving deeply fallible, adding to the uncertainty for investors and policymakers alike.

HOST: Fascinating how digital trends are reshaping even traditional markets. Finally, a quick update on international cricket, which always captures the attention of millions across the globe.

REPORTER: In international cricket news, India is heading into the semi-final stage unbeaten, showcasing strong form, while Afghanistan has had one slip-up against Sri Lanka, but remains a formidable contender. Notably, Stanikzai has come in for Aqil as Afghanistan prepares to bat in a crucial match. Afghanistan has also secured an impressive victory against the West Indies, with Ibrahim Zadran and their bowlers leading the charge effectively, despite Matthew Forde being a bright spot with the bat for West Indies as they ultimately fell 23 runs short in the chase.

HOST: And before we wrap up our sports segment, a quick look back at some of the more unusual sports that once graced the Winter Olympics stage.

REPORTER: For many decades, the Olympic Games included what were known as "demonstration sports" – events showcased to gauge public interest before potential inclusion. While some, like curling, eventually became part of the permanent roster, others, such as skijoring, which involved being pulled on skis by a horse, and the surprisingly artistic ski ballet, didn't quite stick around. These fascinating pastimes offer a quirky glimpse into the evolving history of winter sports and what might have been.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for that incredibly comprehensive and insightful round-up of the week's news. Always a pleasure to have your expertise guiding us through these complex developments.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And that brings us to the end of another Weekly News Round-up. Before we go, here's a surprising fun fact for you: Did you know that in the early 20th century, a form of competitive swimming called "plunge for distance" was an Olympic event? Competitors would dive into the water from a standing position and then remain motionless, allowing their initial momentum to carry them as far as possible before they surfaced. The winner was the one who went the furthest – a far cry from the speed and stroke mechanics of modern Olympic swimming!

Thank you for tuning in. I'm Arjav, and we look forward to bringing you more essential news next week. Have a great day!
