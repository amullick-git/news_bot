    "summary": "<p>Hi HN! I'm currently a Master's student at USTC (University of Science and Technology of China). I've been diving deep into Data Engineering, especially in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs).<p>The Problem:\nI found that learning resources for modern data engineering are often fragmented and scattered across hundreds of medium articles or disjointed tutorials. It's hard to piece everything together into a coherent system.<p>The Solution:\nI decided to open-source my learning notes and build them into a structured book. My goal is to help developers fast-track their learning curve.<p>Key Features:<p>LLM-Centric: Focuses on data pipelines specifically designed for LLM training and RAG systems.<p>Scenario-Based: Instead of just listing tools, I compare different methods/architectures based on specific business scenarios (e.g., \"When to use Vector DB vs. Keyword Search\").<p>Hands-on Projects: Includes full code for real-world implementations, not just \"Hello World\" examples.<p>This is a work in progress, and I'm treating it as \"Book-as-Code\". I would love to hear your feedback on the roadmap or any \"anti-patterns\" I might have included!<p>Check it out:<p>Online: <a href=\"https://datascale-ai.github.io/data_engineering_book/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://datascale-ai.github.io/data_engineering_book/</a><p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/datascale-ai/data_engineering_book\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/datascale-ai/data_engineering_book</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47008163\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47008163</a></p>\n<p>Points: 197</p>\n<p># Comments: 22</p>",
