HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily dive into the headlines shaping our world. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, ready to bring you the stories that matter most, from breaking news to in-depth analysis.

HOST: Absolutely, Arohi. Before we jump into today’s top stories, let’s quickly look at what happened on this day in history. On January 18th, 1919, the Paris Peace Conference opened, bringing together the victorious Allied powers of World War I to set the peace terms for the defeated Central Powers. It ultimately led to the creation of the League of Nations, a pivotal moment in international diplomacy and the pursuit of global stability. A stark reminder of how nations strive to reshape the world order. Today, we're tracking shifts in global power and policy, from the latest in U.S. foreign actions and significant developments in immigration, to major political moves out of Washington and across the globe. We'll also cover vital news from India and unexpected happenings around the world. We’re drawing from reliable sources like BBC News, NDTV News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, CNBC, and many others, to bring you a comprehensive look at what’s happening. Arohi, let’s kick things off with some significant news concerning U.S. military actions abroad. We're seeing reports of another retaliatory strike in Syria. What can you tell us?

REPORTER: That's right. The U.S. has carried out a third round of retaliatory strikes in Syria. This latest action, confirmed by U.S. Central Command, resulted in the death of an Al-Qaeda-affiliated leader. This individual was reportedly linked to a deadly Islamic State ambush, a clear signal of ongoing U.S. efforts to counter militant groups in the region and respond to threats against U.S. personnel. These strikes underscore the persistent challenges of stability and security in the Middle East.

HOST: So, this is part of a broader, sustained effort. And speaking of U.S. involvement in other regions, there's also a fascinating, if concerning, story out of Nigeria, where U.S. airstrikes seem to have been influenced by some rather unconventional sources. Can you elaborate?

REPORTER: This is a remarkable and somewhat troubling report. It reveals how U.S. intervention in Nigeria, specifically regarding airstrikes, has been partially fueled by what's being described as "spotty research" from a Christian activist. Republican lawmakers have reportedly used this activist's information to justify advocating for U.S. military action in the country. This highlights the complex and sometimes opaque pathways through which information, even if unsubstantiated, can influence foreign policy decisions and potentially lead to significant military engagements. It raises questions about the due diligence applied to intelligence sources in such critical matters.

HOST: That's certainly something to keep an eye on. From military actions and the influences behind them, let's pivot to a major diplomatic and economic story dominating headlines: President Trump’s recent moves concerning Greenland and the European Union. Arohi, this has quickly escalated into a potential trade war. What exactly has transpired?

REPORTER: This situation has indeed drawn global attention. President Trump recently stated that eight European nations could face tariffs, potentially rising to 25%, if Greenland is not sold to the United States. He hinted at pursuing a tariff strategy similar to methods previously used to influence foreign countries' drug prices. Further details emerged, with President Trump announcing on social media that a 10% tariff would take effect on February 1st for eight EU countries opposing U.S. control of Greenland. He warned that this tariff would climb to 25% by June 1st if a deal for the U.S. to purchase Greenland isn't in place.

HOST: That’s a significant economic threat. And how has Europe reacted to these demands and the tariff threats?

REPORTER: The reaction has been swift and strong. Europe is now weighing an all-out response. The challenge for European nations is their continued dependence on the United States for NATO security, which naturally limits their immediate options. However, there's talk of Europe potentially retaliating with its own "trade bazooka." This suggests a willingness to engage in a full-scale trade war if necessary, despite the security implications.

HOST: And what about Greenland itself? How are the people and the government responding to the idea of being purchased?

REPORTER: The message from Greenland and Denmark has been unequivocally clear: Greenland is "not for sale." Thousands of people rallied in Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, specifically to protest President Trump's rhetoric and the U.S. desire to acquire Greenland. The protests underscore a strong national sentiment and a rejection of the proposition, highlighting the cultural and sovereign objections to such a move.

HOST: Faisal Islam, the BBC's economics editor, described Trump's threats to allies as "without parallel." What does this diplomatic fallout signify for transatlantic relations?

REPORTER: It signifies a profound challenge to established alliances. Islam's assessment points to the unprecedented nature of these threats, particularly coming from a U.S. president against traditional allies. The situation is baffling leaders of allied nations, causing considerable diplomatic strain and raising concerns about the long-term stability and trustworthiness of these crucial international relationships. It signals a new, more confrontational era in transatlantic diplomacy, where economic leverage is openly used to pursue geopolitical objectives, even with partners.

HOST: A very fluid and critical international story. Moving from foreign policy to domestic issues, immigration continues to be a central topic in the U.S. The New York Times has been covering this extensively, even answering readers' questions about ICE. Arohi, what are some of the key takeaways on the powers and activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement?

REPORTER: The New York Times has addressed many public inquiries about ICE's capabilities and operations. Reporters have clarified that ICE's authority extends to arresting individuals suspected of immigration violations, even those without criminal records, and conducting enforcement actions in various locations, including workplaces and sometimes even near courthouses or schools, though the latter often draws significant criticism. The core message is that ICE operates with broad powers to enforce immigration laws, leading to much public concern and legal debate about the scope and appropriateness of these actions.

HOST: And building on that, The New York Times also released data illustrating differences in deportation approaches between the Trump and Biden administrations. What does that data reveal?

REPORTER: The data obtained by The New York Times, analyzed by their data reporter Albert Sun, illustrates notable differences in deportation strategies. During the Trump administration, there was a clear emphasis on high-volume deportations, often targeting a broader range of undocumented immigrants, regardless of criminal history. The data showed an aggressive push to increase deportations across the board. In contrast, the Biden administration has, at times, indicated a shift towards prioritizing the deportation of individuals who pose a threat to public safety or national security, or those who have recently crossed the border. However, the operational realities and the sheer volume of arrivals at the border have also presented continuous challenges, leading to an evolving approach even under Biden. The data helps quantify these strategic differences and their practical impact.

HOST: It appears the Department of Homeland Security's role is also undergoing scrutiny, particularly as its focus seems to be shifting. What's prompting these questions?

REPORTER: The Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, was established after the 9/11 attacks with a primary mission to counter international terrorism threats. However, recent reports indicate a significant shift, with its most visible targets now often being domestic, particularly in the context of immigration enforcement. This has prompted questions about DHS's evolving mandate and resource allocation. Critics and observers are asking if the department's expansive powers, originally designed for counter-terrorism, are being appropriately applied to a different set of challenges, especially as immigration officers become more visible in U.S. cities, sometimes in roles that diverge from the department's foundational purpose.

HOST: These immigration stories paint a clear picture of the ongoing debates and policy shifts within the U.S. Now, let’s broaden our scope and look at the wider impact of President Trump’s time in office, particularly his first year in what is being referred to as his second term. Arohi, how has this period been characterized?

REPORTER: This past year, the first year of President Trump's second term, has seen a continuation of his distinctive approach to governance and policy. The period has been marked by significant actions across various sectors, from economic policy to international relations, and ongoing debates over domestic policies. While specific details would require extensive analysis, the overarching characterization has been one of assertive policy implementation and a consistent challenge to established norms, which has naturally generated both strong support and significant opposition.

HOST: And this impact isn't just felt domestically. Canada, for instance, has experienced profound effects. What changes have been observed north of the border?

REPORTER: Canada has indeed felt a profound ripple effect from the first year of President Trump's second term. The impacts have been wide-ranging, touching its politics, economy, and even daily life. For instance, there's been a reported surge in patriotism within Canada, often attributed to a desire to differentiate itself or reinforce its identity in response to U.S. political developments. Economically, trade relations have seen adjustments, and there's been a noticeable shift in Canadian consumer behavior, including a reported decrease in U.S. travel and shopping trips. This indicates a significant re-evaluation of the Canada-U.S. relationship from the Canadian perspective.

HOST: From U.S. politics to a very different kind of headline: we have initial names being announced for President Trump's 'Board of Peace' overseeing Gaza's reconstruction. Arohi, what can you tell us about this initiative?

REPORTER: The first names of those who will oversee the next phase of the U.S. president's peace plan for Gaza have been announced. This "Board of Peace" is tasked with guiding the reconstruction efforts in Gaza, a critical component of the broader peace initiative. The identities of these individuals are expected to provide insight into the administration's strategic approach and the specific expertise they hope to leverage in a region that desperately needs stability and development. The appointments signal a concrete step in attempting to move forward with post-conflict recovery and a long-term vision for the area.

HOST: Shifting continents now, let's turn to some news out of India. Arohi, the ongoing ethnic violence in Manipur continues to be a deeply distressing situation. We're seeing reports of displaced tribals seeking answers regarding land allocations. What are the details here?

REPORTER: The ethnic violence in Manipur has, tragically, claimed over 260 lives and caused immense displacement. Recent reports indicate that displaced tribals are seeking answers from the civil group ITLF, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum, regarding allegations of being charged "Rs 3,000 per plot" and having their papers taken. These displaced individuals are expressing concerns and demanding transparency regarding the allocation of land and the handling of their documentation during this crisis. It highlights the desperate situation for those affected and the challenges in ensuring fair treatment and accountability amidst such widespread conflict.

HOST: A very sensitive situation. And in other significant Indian news, TVK Chief Vijay is once again summoned by the CBI. What's the latest on the Karur stampede case?

REPORTER: TVK Chief Vijay is slated to appear before the CBI in Delhi again concerning the Karur stampede case. This follows an earlier questioning session at the CBI headquarters on January 12th. The stampede incident caused widespread shock and outrage across Tamil Nadu, and the CBI's repeated summoning of Vijay underscores the gravity of the investigation and the determination to uncover the full circumstances surrounding the tragic event. His journey to Delhi signals a continuing and high-profile legal process.

HOST: Moving to a different aspect of global engagement, Arohi, there's an interesting development from the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Dettol Hygiene Loyalty Card is making its global debut. Can you explain what this initiative entails?

REPORTER: This is an innovative initiative making its global debut at the World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos. Under the #BanegaSwasthIndia campaign, the Dettol Hygiene Loyalty Card aims to redefine hygiene as a "currency of trust." It’s designed to reward everyday actions that promote hygiene and build safer communities. Essentially, it’s a program that incentivizes and acknowledges individuals for maintaining good hygiene practices, aiming to integrate health and cleanliness into a broader loyalty framework. It's a fascinating blend of public health and consumer engagement on a global stage.

HOST: That's an interesting approach to public health. Now, let's take a quick look at some other stories from around the world. We have a shocking incident out of the idyllic French island of Corsica. What happened there?

REPORTER: Corsica, typically known for its beautiful landscapes, has been profoundly shaken by a recent gangland killing at a funeral. This incident brings into stark relief the island's concerning reality of having one of the highest murder rates in France. The public nature and location of the shooting have intensified the shock, highlighting the pervasive issue of organized crime and violence within what is otherwise perceived as an idyllic setting. It's a stark reminder that even picturesque locations can face severe societal challenges.

HOST: And finally, a story that offers a more uplifting perspective on a continent often misrepresented in global media. A YouTube star is touring Africa, aiming to showcase its true essence. What message is he conveying?

REPORTER: This YouTube star is on a maiden tour of Africa with a clear mission: to show the world the vibrant and positive realities of the continent. He's bringing joy and tears to audiences, emphasizing the rich culture, energy, and warmth he's encountered. His quote, "I love the love in Africa. The energy here is crazy," encapsulates his goal to counter stereotypes and highlight the immense positivity, creativity, and community spirit that defines much of Africa. It’s a powerful narrative shift, focusing on celebration and connection.

HOST: Absolutely. And before we sign off for the day, here's a surprising fact for our listeners: Did you know that the shortest war in history lasted only 38 to 45 minutes? It occurred between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896. Zanzibar surrendered after less than an hour of bombardment. That’s even quicker than our news briefing today!
