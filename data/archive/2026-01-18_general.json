    "title": "Show HN: GibRAM an in-memory ephemeral GraphRAG runtime for retrieval",
    "summary": "<p>Hi HN,<p>I have been working with regulation-heavy documents lately, and one thing kept bothering me. Flat RAG pipelines often fail to retrieve related articles together, even when they are clearly connected through references, definitions, or clauses.<p>After trying several RAG setups, I subjectively felt that GraphRAG was a better mental model for this kind of data. The Microsoft GraphRAG paper and reference implementation were helpful starting points. However, in practice, I found one recurring friction point: graph storage and vector indexing are usually handled by separate systems, which felt unnecessarily heavy for short-lived analysis tasks.<p>To explore this tradeoff, I built GibRAM (Graph in-buffer Retrieval and Associative Memory). It is an experimental, in-memory GraphRAG runtime where entities, relationships, text units, and embeddings live side by side in a single process.<p>GibRAM is intentionally ephemeral. It is designed for exploratory tasks like summarization or conversational querying over a bounded document set. Data lives in memory, scoped by session, and is automatically cleaned up via TTL. There are no durability guarantees, and recomputation is considered cheaper than persistence for the intended use cases.<p>This is not a database and not a production-ready system. It is a casual project, largely vibe-coded, meant to explore what GraphRAG looks like when memory is the primary constraint instead of storage. Technical debt exists, and many tradeoffs are explicit.<p>The project is open source, and I would really appreciate feedback, especially from people working on RAG, search infrastructure, or graph-based retrieval.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/gibram-io/gibram\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/gibram-io/gibram</a><p>Happy to answer questions or hear why this approach might be flawed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665393\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665393</a></p>\n<p>Points: 35</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Hello all!<p>I've been an avid fan of Pocket Operators by Teenage Engineering since I found out about them. I even own an EP-133 K.O. II today, which I love.<p>A couple of months ago, Reddit user andiam03 shared a Google Sheet with some drum patterns [1]. I thought it was a very cool way to share and understand beats.<p>During the weekend I coded a basic version of this app I am sharing today. I iterated over it in my free time, and yesterday I felt like I had a pretty good version to share with y'all.<p>It's not meant to be a sequencer but rather a way to experiment with beats and basic sounds, save them, and use them in your songs. It also has a sharing feature with a link.<p>It was built using Tone.js [2], Stimulus [3] and deployed in Render [4] as a static website. I used an LLM to read the Tone.js documentation and generate sounds, since I have no knowledge about sound production, and modified from there.<p>Anyway, hope you like it! I had a blast building it.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https://teenage.engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://teenage.engineering</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMRWxEqcZGdBzJg52soeVaY7iUSj1YncfIJZIPScBhM/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMRWxEqcZGdBzJg52soe...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://tonejs.github.io</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://stimulus.hotwired.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://stimulus.hotwired.dev</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"http://render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://render.com</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46672181\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46672181</a></p>\n<p>Points: 45</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Hey HN, Lume is an open-source CLI for running macOS and Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Since launch (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061</a>), we've been using it to run AI agents in isolated macOS environments. We needed VMs that could set themselves up, so we built that.<p>Here's what's new in 0.2:<p>*Unattended Setup* \u2013 Go from IPSW to a fully configured VM without touching the keyboard. We built a VNC + OCR system that clicks through macOS Setup Assistant automatically. No more manual setup before pushing to a registry:<p><pre><code>  lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n</code></pre>\nYou can write custom YAML configs to set up any macOS version your way.<p>*HTTP API + Daemon* \u2013 A REST API on port 7777 that runs as a background service. Your scripts and CI pipelines can manage VMs that persist even if your terminal closes:<p><pre><code>  curl -X POST localhost:7777/lume/vms/my-vm/run -d '{\"noDisplay\": true}'\n</code></pre>\n*MCP Server* \u2013 Native integration with Claude Desktop and AI coding agents. Claude can create, run, and execute commands in VMs directly:<p><pre><code>  # Add to Claude Desktop config\n  \"lume\": { \"command\": \"lume\", \"args\": [\"serve\", \"--mcp\"] }\n    \n  # Then just ask: \"Create a sandbox VM and run my tests\"\n</code></pre>\n*Multi-location Storage* \u2013 macOS disk space is always tight, so from user feedback we added support for external drives. Add an SSD, move VMs between locations:<p><pre><code>  lume config storage add external-ssd /Volumes/ExternalSSD/lume\n  lume clone my-vm backup --source-storage default --dest-storage external-ssd\n</code></pre>\n*Registry Support* \u2013 Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS. Create a golden image once, share it across your team.<p>We're seeing people use Lume for:\n- Running Claude Code in an isolated VM (your host stays clean, reset mistakes by cloning)\n- CI/CD pipelines for Apple platform apps\n- Automated UI testing across macOS versions\n- Disposable sandboxes for security research<p>To get started:<p><pre><code>  /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)\"\n\n  lume create sandbox --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n  lume run sandbox --shared-dir ~/my-project\n</code></pre>\nLume is MIT licensed and Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4) since it uses Apple's native Virtualization Framework directly\u2014no emulation.<p>Lume runs on EC2 Mac instances and Scaleway if you need cloud infrastructure. We're also working on a managed cloud offering for teams that need macOS compute on demand\u2014if you're interested, reach out.<p>We're actively developing this as part of Cua (<a href=\"https://github.com/trycua/cua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trycua/cua</a>), our Computer Use Agent SDK.
