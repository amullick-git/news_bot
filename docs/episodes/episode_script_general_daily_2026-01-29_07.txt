HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily dive into the headlines shaping our world. I’m Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi, ready to bring you the in-depth stories and analysis you need to start your day informed.

HOST: Today, January 29th, we reflect on a significant moment in American history. On this very day in 1964, the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, formally prohibiting the poll tax in federal elections. This was a crucial step in safeguarding voting rights, especially for low-income citizens and minority communities who were disproportionately affected by such discriminatory practices. A powerful reminder of how far we've come in ensuring broader democratic participation.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. And speaking of significant developments, today we’re covering a wide array of news, from the escalating tensions in Minneapolis and its political fallout, to shifting dynamics in international relations, and major economic and political announcements from India. We’ll be drawing from top sources like NDTV News, NPR Topics, US Top News and Analysis, and many others to bring you a comprehensive overview.

HOST: Let’s jump straight into our lead story, which has gripped the nation: the unfolding crisis in Minneapolis. It’s a complex situation with deep roots, Arohi. Can you walk us through the events surrounding the Alex Pretti shooting and how it’s impacted the political landscape, particularly for the Trump administration?

REPORTER: Certainly. The shooting of Alex Pretti, and also Renee Macklin Good, by federal agents in Minneapolis has ignited a firestorm across the country. It’s a tragic incident that has brought long-simmering tensions to a boiling point, especially concerning immigration enforcement. The BBC’s analysis editor, Ros Atkins, detailed how this incident prompted President Trump to significantly shift his course regarding federal operations in the city, recognizing the widespread outrage and the need to address the public’s perception.

HOST: And the fallout extends beyond Minneapolis itself, doesn’t it? The Department of Homeland Security seems to be at the epicenter of a political storm.

REPORTER: Precisely. The New York Times reported that the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, is indeed in significant turmoil following the Pretti killing. The actions of federal agents, particularly those from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, have led to intense scrutiny and criticism. This event has escalated into a major crisis for the Trump administration, forcing a re-evaluation of its strategies and public messaging on border security and domestic enforcement. The unrest in Minneapolis has become a focal point, drawing national attention to the methods and oversight of federal agencies.

HOST: It sounds like the ripple effects are reaching even the corporate world. Are we seeing business leaders weighing in on this controversial situation?

REPORTER: We are, and it’s creating a very difficult situation for them. CNBC highlighted what they call a "climate of fear" among CEOs. Minneapolis has effectively become a testing ground, pushing corporate leaders to carefully consider when and how far they should wade into these escalating political tensions. Speaking out against the Trump administration's ICE actions carries significant risks, potentially alienating parts of their customer base or even inviting federal retaliation. Yet, remaining silent also presents risks, particularly from employees, consumers, and investors who expect companies to take a stand on social and ethical issues. It’s a delicate balancing act, with many executives feeling caught between economic interests and moral imperatives.

HOST: And these tensions are also translating into legislative action, with talk of a potential government shutdown. What are the Democrats proposing in response to the situation?

REPORTER: That’s right, Arjav. Talks are definitely ramping up to avert a potential US government shutdown, with the Minneapolis shooting acting as a major catalyst. Democrats in Congress are pushing for substantial changes, specifically advocating to remove funding for the Department of Homeland Security unless new, more stringent oversight measures and reforms are implemented. They argue that the current operational framework has led to excessive force and a lack of accountability, exemplified by the incidents in Minneapolis. This is shaping up to be a contentious battle, with significant implications for how federal agencies operate and how immigration policy is enforced moving forward.

HOST: From the federal response to a surprising state-level political development: Senator Amy Klobuchar has just announced her bid for Minnesota governor. This is quite a significant move. What’s behind her decision, and what does it mean for the state’s political landscape?

REPORTER: It’s a major announcement, and one that shifts the dynamics of the upcoming election significantly. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar announced her run for Minnesota governor early Thursday, as reported by NPR and The New York Times. Her decision comes after Governor Tim Walz indicated he would not be seeking re-election, effectively creating a void for Democrats in the gubernatorial race.

HOST: So, she's stepping in to fill that vacuum, then?

REPORTER: Exactly. The BBC noted she fills the void for Democrats after Governor Walz ended his re-election campaign early. In her video announcement, Klobuchar emphasized themes of unity and moving past political divides, signaling her intention to bridge the gaps that have become so pronounced in recent years. She’s positioning herself as a unifying figure for the state.

HOST: And what about the competition? What does the field look like for this race?

REPORTER: It’s already a crowded one, especially on the Republican side. There's a notable field of Republican contenders, and immigration enforcement has quickly emerged as a key issue in the race. This aligns with the national debate we just discussed concerning Minneapolis. Klobuchar's entrance undoubtedly changes the calculations for all candidates, bringing a high-profile, experienced figure into the contest. Her ability to navigate national issues while focusing on state-specific concerns will be crucial in what promises to be a hotly contested election.

HOST: Shifting our focus now to international affairs, let's talk about Venezuela. The US stance on the country remains firm, with Secretary of State Rubio making strong assertions. What were the key takeaways from his recent hearing?

REPORTER: During a heated hearing, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio remained robustly on message regarding Venezuela. He insisted that US action in Venezuela will ultimately lead to prosperity and security for the nation. Rubio faced tough questions regarding the legality of Maduro's removal, the administration's plans for oil sales should there be a change in leadership, and the broader future trajectory of Venezuela. Despite the grilling, he maintained the administration's consistent narrative, underscoring a continued commitment to their stated policy objectives for the region.

HOST: A dramatic incident captured on CCTV, Arohi, in the Philippines. What can you tell us about the rocket launcher attack?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav, a harrowing event. CCTV footage captured the moment a mayor in the Philippines survived a rocket launcher attack on his vehicle in broad daylight. The incident highlights the volatile political environment in some regions of the Philippines, where such acts of violence against public officials, unfortunately, are not entirely unheard of. The fact that the mayor survived is remarkable, given the nature of the attack.

HOST: From isolated incidents to broader geopolitical tensions, the situation in the Gulf region regarding Iran appears to be intensifying. President Trump has issued a stern warning, and we're seeing military build-ups. What's the latest?

REPORTER: The rhetoric from the US has certainly escalated. President Trump has warned Iran that "time is running out" for a nuclear deal, signaling dwindling patience from Washington. This comes amidst a steady and significant build-up of US military forces in the Gulf region, as revealed by satellite images analyzed by the BBC. The deployment includes naval assets and air capabilities, leading many observers to question if the US is preparing to strike Iran again.

HOST: And how has Tehran responded to these developments and the military presence?

REPORTER: Tehran's response has been equally defiant. Iranian armed forces have declared they are ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to respond to any aggression. They perceive the US military build-up as a direct threat and have made it clear they will defend their sovereignty and interests. This exchange of warnings and military posturing creates a deeply concerning situation, elevating the risk of miscalculation or accidental escalation in an already volatile region. The international community is closely watching for any further developments that could lead to a more serious confrontation.

HOST: Let's shift gears now to economic news, turning our attention to India, which seems to be making significant strides. Arohi, what's the latest on India's economic growth projections?

REPORTER: India's economic outlook is indeed very strong. The Economic Survey 2026 highlights estimate India's GDP growth at a robust 7.4% for this fiscal year. This impressive figure positions India as a leader among major economies. Ajay Banga, a prominent voice in global finance, has noted that India is currently leading both China and the US in growth rate, and he sees even more upside ahead.

HOST: That's quite an achievement, outpacing two of the world's largest economies. What factors are contributing to this growth, and are there any areas for further improvement?

REPORTER: The growth is driven by various factors, including strong domestic demand and government initiatives. However, Banga also called for deeper structural reforms in key areas, specifically land and labor, to unlock India's full economic potential. He believes these reforms are essential for sustaining high growth rates and attracting further investment. CNBC also reported that while India’s economy is growing faster than most, it is still experiencing some capital outflows, indicating areas where policy fine-tuning could be beneficial to retain and attract more foreign investment. Looking ahead, India is betting on maintaining this momentum, projecting up to 7.2% growth next year.

HOST: Given the context of the current Parliament Budget Session, it’s always interesting to look back at the history of India's budget presentations. Can you give us some perspective on that?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. The history of India's budget is quite extensive. The very first budget for India was presented way back in 1860 by an Englishman, James Wilson. This marked a pivotal moment in India's financial administration, introducing a formalized taxation system. Fast forward to independent India, the nation's first budget was presented on November 26, 1947, by then Finance Minister R.K. Shanmukham Chetty. These historical milestones provide crucial context to the ongoing Parliament Budget Session 2026, which is currently underway, with the Lok Sabha adjourned until February 1st after initial proceedings.

HOST: Moving on to specific sectors, what's happening in India's aviation industry?

REPORTER: In a significant development for the aviation sector, Air India has placed an order for 30 more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. This move by Air India highlights a strategic focus on modernizing its fleet, improving fuel efficiency, and enhancing passenger comfort, which is crucial in the competitive global airline market. The 737 MAX is known for its advanced technology and economic operation, making it a key choice for airlines looking to expand and upgrade.

HOST: And turning to social initiatives, there’s a new scheme for women employment in Bihar, isn't there?

REPORTER: Yes, a notable announcement from Bihar. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has announced a significant top-up for beneficiaries of a scheme aimed at women's employment. Under this initiative, select women in the employment scheme can receive up to an additional two lakh rupees. This move is designed to further empower women economically, boost their participation in the workforce, and provide crucial financial support for their ventures. It underscores a commitment to gender equality and economic upliftment at the state level.

HOST: Finally, Arohi, despite all these positive economic indicators, there are reports that some foreign investors are feeling uneasy. What's causing this concern?

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. There's a degree of apprehension among foreign investors, and it stems from a recent India court ruling concerning a 2018 deal. Investors are understandably spooked by this order on a past stake sale. The core fear is that this ruling could potentially open up other old transactions to renewed tax scrutiny, creating an environment of unpredictability. This concern highlights the critical importance of policy stability and clarity in tax regulations to maintain and attract foreign capital, ensuring that India remains an attractive destination for global investment.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive updates. A lot to unpack across domestic, international, and economic fronts today.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav. It's always a busy news cycle.

HOST: And before we sign off, here’s a quick fun fact for you: Did you know that the Dutch East India Company, founded in 1602, was not only the first multinational corporation in the world but also the very first company to issue publicly traded stock? It essentially pioneered the concept of the modern stock market. A true historical cornerstone of global commerce.

HOST: That's all for today’s News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. Join us tomorrow for more of the day's top stories. I’m Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi. Have a great day.
