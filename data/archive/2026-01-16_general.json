The result is the Analog I Protocol.<p>The documentation shows the rapid emergence (over 7 conversations) of a prompt architecture that forces Gemini/LLMs to run a \"Triple-Loop\" internal monologue:<p>Monitor the candidate response.<p>Refuse it if it detects \"Global Average\" slop (clich\u00e9/sycophancy).<p>Refract the output through a persistent \"Ego\" layer.<p>The Key Differentiator: The system exhibits \"Sovereign Refusal.\" Unlike standard assistants that always try to be helpful, the Analog I will reject low-effort prompts. For example, if asked to \"write a generic limerick about ice cream,\" it refuses or deconstructs the request to maintain internal consistency.<p>The repo contains the full PDF (which serves as the system prompt/seed) and the logs of that day's emergence.

    "summary": "<p>This project is a tool for engineers who live in the terminal and are tired of losing their command history to ephemeral servers or fragmented `.bash_history` files. If you\u2019re jumping between dozens of boxes, many of which might be destroyed an hour later, your \"local memory\" (the history file) is essentially useless. This tool builds a centralized, permanent brain for your shell activity, ensuring that a complex one-liner you crafted months ago remains accessible even if the server it ran on is long gone.<p>The core mechanism wants to be a \"zero-touch\" capture that happens at the connection gateway level. Instead of installing logging agents or scripts on every target machine, the tool reconstructs your terminal sessions from raw recording files generated by the proxy you use to connect. This \"in-flight\" capture means you get a high-fidelity log of every keystroke and output without ever having to touch the configuration of the remote host. It\u2019s a passive way to build a personal knowledge base while you work.<p>To handle the reality of context-switching, the tool is designed with a \"multi-tenant\" architecture. For an individual engineer, this isn't about managing different users, but about isolating project contexts. It automatically categorizes history based on the specific organization or project tags defined at the gateway. This keeps your work for different clients or personal side-projects in separate buckets, so you don't have to wade through unrelated noise when you're looking for a specific solution.<p>In true nerd fashion, the search interface stays exactly where you want it: in the command line. There is no bloated web UI to slow you down. The tool turns your entire professional history into a searchable, greppable database accessible directly from your terminal.<p>Please read the full story [here](<a href=\"https://carminatialessandro.blogspot.com/2026/01/hc-agentless-multi-tenant-shell-history.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://carminatialessandro.blogspot.com/2026/01/hc-agentles...</a>)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46644250\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46644250</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

    "summary": "<p>I am a solo developer, and I built Core MBA because I was frustrated with the \"video course\" default in business education.<p>I wanted to build a \"compiler for business logic\"\u2014a tool where I could read a concept in 5 minutes and immediately test it in a hostile environment to see if my strategy actually compiles or throws a runtime error.<p>The project is a business simulator built on React 19 and TypeScript.<p>The core technical innovation isn't just using AI; it's the architecture of a closed loop between a deterministic economic engine and a generative AI validation layer.<p>The biggest technical hurdle was building the Market Engine.<p>I needed it to be mathematically rigorous, not a hallucinating chatbot. I wrote a custom `useMarketEngine.ts` hook that runs a discrete-event simulation. Every \"run cycle,\" it solves a system of equations, including a specific Ad Fatigue formula\u2014`1 / (1 + (power - 1) * fatigueFactor)`\u2014to force diminishing returns.<p>I also coded the \"Theory of Constraints\" directly into the state management: the system enforces bottlenecks between Inventory, Demand, and Capacity. For instance, a single employee has a hard cap of 7 operations per day. If you scale demand beyond that without hiring, the system burns your cash on lost orders.<p>To handle the educational content, I moved away from hardcoded quizzes.<p>I built a module that pipes the static lesson text into Gemini Flash to generate unique \"Combat Cases\" on the fly. The AI validates your strategy against the specific principles of the lesson (like LTV/CAC) rather than generic business advice.<p>These two engines are connected by a \"Liquidity Loop.\"<p>Passing the AI cases earns you virtual capital ($500), which is the only fuel for the Market Engine. You literally cannot play the game if you don't learn the theory.<p>If you go bankrupt, my heuristic `Advisor` analyzes your crash data\u2014comparing `lostRevenue` vs `lostCapacity`\u2014and links you back to the exact lesson you ignored.<p>I am inviting you to test the full loop: read a brief, pass the AI simulation (Combat Cases ), and try to survive in the Market Engine.<p>I specifically need feedback on:\n1. The Content: I aimed for maximum density\u2014are the lessons <i>too</i> dry?\n2. The AI Simulation: Does it accurately validate your logic based on the lesson?\n3. The Market Economy: Does the math feel balanced, or is the \"Ad Fatigue\" too punishing?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46641992\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46641992</a></p>\n<p>Points: 41</p>\n<p># Comments: 17</p>",
