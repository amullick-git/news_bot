HOST: Good morning and welcome to Weekly Tech Round-up! I'm Arjav, and joining me today, as always, is our brilliant reporter, Arohi, to bring you the latest and most impactful stories from the world of technology. Today, we're diving deep into the intricate dance of artificial intelligence, from its use in cybercrime to its transformative power in enterprise, alongside updates from major players like Apple and Microsoft, and a look at the broader tech landscape.

But first, let's take a quick trip back in time for our "On This Day in History" segment. On February 14th, 1946, seventy-eight years ago today, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC, was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania. This colossal machine, considered one of the first electronic general-purpose computers, laid foundational groundwork for all the digital advancements we cover today, including the very AI that dominates our headlines.

Today, we're drawing insights from leading tech publications like Ars Technica, TechCrunch, MIT Technology Review, Hacker News, and many others, to give you the clearest picture of what's happening. Arohi, let's jump right into perhaps the most pressing topic: the double-edged sword of artificial intelligence. We're seeing increasing reports about AI being leveraged for cybercrime, but also its potential to enhance security. What's the latest?

REPORTER: That's right. The headlines are stark. AI is already making online crimes significantly easier, and experts fear it could get much worse. Just as software engineers use AI to write code and check for bugs, malicious actors are adopting these tools to craft more sophisticated attacks. We've seen reports, like those from MIT Technology Review, highlighting how AI-enhanced cybercrime is evolving. For instance, a cybersecurity researcher named Anton Cherepanov recently spotted a file on VirusTotal that appeared to be leveraging AI to generate polymorphic malware, making it incredibly difficult to detect. This really signals a new frontier in the arms race between cybercriminals and security experts.

HOST: That sounds concerning. So, what are the implications for individuals and organizations, and what's being done on the defense side?

REPORTER: The implications are widespread. Microsoft recently warned users about critical zero-day bugs being actively exploited to target Windows and Office users. These vulnerabilities allow hackers to take complete control of a victim's computer with just a malicious link or file. It's a stark reminder for everyone to patch their systems immediately. On the defensive front, companies like Vega Security are stepping up, having just raised an impressive $120 million in Series B funding. Their goal is to completely rethink how enterprises detect cyber threats, suggesting a push for AI-powered, proactive defense mechanisms to counter these new attack vectors. However, there are also broader concerns, with some reports suggesting America's cyber defense agencies are facing significant challenges and might not be equipped to handle the escalating threats effectively.

HOST: It's a challenging landscape indeed. Now, let's shift from defense to development. Beyond the threats, AI is rapidly transforming how businesses operate and innovate. Arohi, how is AI changing the game for enterprises and startups?

REPORTER: AI is fundamentally reshaping the business landscape, particularly for startups. Amanda Silver, a corporate vice president at Microsoft’s CoreAI division, emphasizes that AI is changing the "math" for new companies, pushing them towards developing agentic systems that don't just answer questions but actively perform tasks within organizations. We're seeing this trend reflected in significant funding rounds. Glean, for example, which started as an enterprise search product, is now evolving into an "AI work assistant" aiming to sit beneath other AI tools, providing that foundational AI layer for various organizational functions.

HOST: So it's not just about chatbots anymore, but about AI that takes action? Can you give us some more concrete examples of these agentic systems in action?

REPORTER: Absolutely. We’re seeing specialized AI solutions emerge across different industries. Gather AI, for instance, a company making "curious" warehouse drones, just landed $40 million in funding. Their system doesn't just scan inventory; it actively seeks out specific data points, making warehouse management far more efficient and precise. In manufacturing, Didero recently secured $30 million for its "agentic" autopilot for procurement. This AI layer sits on top of existing enterprise resource planning systems, reading communications and automatically executing necessary updates and tasks, effectively putting procurement on autopilot. This is about automation at a deeply integrated level.

HOST: That’s incredibly powerful. And how is this impacting the broader workforce and traditional industries like energy?

REPORTER: The impact is significant. IBM, for example, plans to triple its entry-level hiring in the U.S. in 2026, but the tasks for these new roles will be fundamentally different, influenced by AI integration. It signals a shift in required skills and how human roles will complement AI. In the energy sector, Tem just raised $75 million to leverage AI to remake electricity markets, specifically to cut costs through an AI-powered transaction engine. This could lead to more efficient and affordable energy distribution globally, as they plan to expand to the U.S. and Australia. Even consumer-facing giants like Airbnb are planning to bake more AI features into their platform, aiming to enhance everything from search and discovery to customer support and engineering. It's a pervasive transformation.

HOST: From critical infrastructure to booking your next vacation, AI is clearly everywhere. Now, let's talk about the buzz and the bleeding edge of AI development. The industry has seen its share of hype. Arohi, what's new on the innovation front, and how are we discerning genuine progress from "AI theater"?

REPORTER: That's a great question, and it's something many are grappling with. MIT Technology Review has launched a new newsletter called "Making AI Work," specifically aimed at exploring how AI is being used in professional applications across diverse fields like healthcare, climate tech, and education, cutting through some of the noise. This initiative reflects a desire to focus on practical, impactful implementations rather than just theoretical capabilities.

HOST: And speaking of hype, there was quite a lot of discussion around something called "Moltbook." What exactly was that, and why was it so hyped, even being compared to Pokémon?

REPORTER: Moltbook was a fascinating phenomenon, described as "peak AI theater" by some. For a few days, it became a hot internet hangout, essentially a Reddit clone designed as a social network for bots to interact with each other. It generated significant hype, with many influential tech figures seeing it as a glimpse into the future, similar to the initial frenzy around Pokémon. The idea was that AI agents could engage in complex social interactions, and humans would just watch. This trend is even expanding, with a new space-based MMO called "SpaceMolt" designed exclusively for AI agents, where humans are spectators. It really highlights the experimental and sometimes speculative nature of AI development right now.

HOST: It sounds like we're moving into a world where AIs might be playing games with each other, rather than with us. What about concrete advancements in AI tools and global competition in the space?

REPORTER: On the innovation side, OpenAI has released a new version of its coding tool, Codex, which is now powered by a dedicated chip. This marks a significant milestone in its relationship with chipmakers, indicating a focus on optimizing hardware for AI-specific tasks. We also saw a compelling "Show HN" submission from a computer systems engineering student who fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B on 100 films to create CineGraphs.ai, a tool that generates probabilistic story graphs for screenwriters. It's a novel application that moves beyond generic AI writing by understanding cinematic structure. Globally, China is making significant strides in open-source AI. The past year has been a turning point, with Chinese companies repeatedly delivering impressive AI models since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, pushing the boundaries of what open-source models can achieve.

HOST: Fascinating to see the innovation from all corners. Let's pivot now to some of the major tech giants. Apple is always in the news, and this week is no exception with reports of new hardware and some regulatory scrutiny. What can you tell us, Arohi?

REPORTER: Apple is reportedly gearing up for a busy period of hardware releases. Reports suggest imminent updates include new MacBook Pros, various iPad models, and even an iPhone 17e. This indicates a refresh across their high-end Mac line and a focus on both premium and more accessible iPhone and iPad options. On the software front, iOS 26.3 has just been released, and interestingly, some of its updates mainly benefit non-Apple devices, making it a little easier for users to migrate from iOS to Android if they choose to. This move could potentially ease some of the antitrust pressures Apple has faced.

HOST: Beyond hardware and software, Apple is also making moves in content and facing some challenges, correct?

REPORTER: That's right. In a significant content acquisition, Apple has acquired all rights to the critically acclaimed series "Severance," planning to produce future seasons in-house. The show is expected to run for four seasons, with potential for spin-offs, prequels, and even foreign versions, signaling a deepening commitment to original programming. However, Apple is also facing regulatory heat. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has aired concerns over allegations that Apple News suppresses right-wing content. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson cited reports from the Media Research Center, a right-leaning think tank, accusing Apple of excluding certain outlets from its top news feeds. This raises important questions about platform neutrality and content moderation.

HOST: An interesting mix of expansion and scrutiny for Apple. Moving over to Microsoft, we also have some news regarding their operating system and continued cybersecurity vigilance.

REPORTER: Indeed. Microsoft is offering a special version of its operating system, "Windows 11 26H1," exclusively for new Arm PCs. This demonstrates how Arm-based computers continue to receive special treatment from Microsoft, focusing on optimizing the OS for these specific architectures. As we touched on earlier, Microsoft is also at the forefront of warning users about critical zero-day bugs. They've emphasized that hackers are actively exploiting these flaws to target Windows and Office users, reiterating the urgency for users to apply patches to prevent complete computer takeover.

HOST: It's a constant battle on the cybersecurity front. Beyond the major players, what else is happening in terms of data breaches and tech policy?

REPORTER: We’ve seen several notable incidents. Archive.today, a popular web archiving site, is facing controversy after its CAPTCHA page allegedly executed a DDoS attack on a blog that tried to uncover its founder's identity. This has led to Wikipedia considering banning the site. Separately, fintech lending giant Figure has confirmed a data breach, stating that hackers downloaded "a limited number of files" after compromising an employee's account. The hacking group ShinyHunters has taken responsibility for this breach. And Discord is facing backlash over new age verification checks, which require selfies or IDs for adult content access, particularly after a prior data breach exposed 70,000 user IDs. These events collectively highlight the ongoing challenges of data security and privacy in the digital age.

HOST: A lot to keep track of there. Finally, let's broaden our view to a global tech trend: electric vehicles. Arohi, how are EVs progressing in Africa?

REPORTER: Electric vehicles are definitely gaining ground in Africa, mirroring a global trend of becoming cheaper and more common. However, the technology still faces significant challenges across the continent. Many regions have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and even areas with widespread electricity access can suffer from reliability issues, which is a major hurdle for EV owners. Despite these challenges, there's a clear momentum towards EV adoption, driven by falling costs and increasing awareness, with various initiatives underway to build out the necessary infrastructure.

HOST: It's great to see global adoption despite the hurdles. Before we sign off, I wanted to quickly mention the passing of Robert Tinney, the iconic Byte magazine artist. His vivid cover art played a crucial role in visualizing personal computing in its nascent stages, truly illustrating the birth of PCs for a generation. A significant figure in tech history.

REPORTER: A true pioneer, Arjav. His work helped define the early aesthetic of personal computing.

HOST: Absolutely. And that brings us to the end of our show for today. Before we go, here's a unique tech fun fact for you: Did you know that the "QWERTY" keyboard layout, originally designed in the 1870s for typewriters, wasn't to optimize typing speed but actually to slow typists down to prevent typewriter keys from jamming? It’s a design legacy from a bygone era that persists today, long after the original mechanical constraints disappeared.

Thank you, Arohi, for another insightful round-up. And thank you all for tuning in. We appreciate you joining us for the Weekly Tech Round-up. Until next time, stay curious, stay informed, and stay secure. I'm Arjav, signing off.
