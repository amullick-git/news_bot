HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! Your daily dive into the headlines that shape our world. On this day in 1908, the first long-distance radio message was successfully sent from the Eiffel Tower in Paris, reaching a distance of 400 miles – a pivotal moment in global communication. Today, we continue that tradition of connection, bringing you top stories from BBC News, Cricket news from ESPN Cricinfo.com, NDTV News, The New York Times, CNBC, and other trusted sources. Joining me as always is our stellar reporter, Arohi, to break down the latest. Arohi, let's jump right into a major development reverberating through the financial markets and Washington D.C. – the escalating tension between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve. What’s the latest?

REPORTER: Good evening. It’s a significant story, and one that saw a dramatic turn this week. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now reportedly under a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. This development follows immense pressure from President Trump to cut interest rates, and it marks a major escalation in that campaign. The market response has been notable; initially, it’s gently shrugging off Trump’s attack, but fears are growing.

HOST: A criminal investigation into the Fed Chair is unprecedented. How are markets reacting beyond that initial shrug?

REPORTER: Precisely. The situation has intensified what analysts are calling the "Sell America" trade. We’re seeing the dollar drop and gold prices surge, reflecting growing concerns about the stability and independence of the U.S. financial system amid this political interference. It’s a clear signal that the market is now pricing in the potential for significant disruption.

HOST: That's a profound shift. Moving from domestic economic policy to international energy, President Trump has been very vocal about Venezuela’s oil. What’s his current stance and what are the implications?

REPORTER: Trump's fixation on Venezuela’s oil reserves continues, raising questions about the true value of "energy dominance" in the current global climate. He’s been particularly aggressive towards energy companies, specifically Exxon Mobil. Shortly after Exxon CEO Darren Woods stated that the Venezuelan market is "uninvestable" in its current state, President Trump threatened to sideline the company, saying they're "playing too cute." This indicates a willingness to use executive power to influence corporate decisions regarding foreign policy.

HOST: And how does this aggressive stance play into broader trade policy, particularly with countries like Iran?

REPORTER: It fits right in. President Trump announced a new, aggressive tariff policy aimed at Iran. He stated that any country doing business with Iran will face a 25% U.S. tariff. This comes as Iran is grappling with widespread anti-government protests, adding another layer of economic pressure to a country already in turmoil.

HOST: Shifting gears to more positive trade news, there are reports of a potential trade deal brewing with Taiwan. Can you give us the details on that?

REPORTER: Yes, the Trump administration is reportedly nearing a trade deal with Taiwan. This agreement would cut tariffs and, crucially, include a commitment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC – the island’s chip giant – to build more manufacturing plants in the United States. This move is clearly aimed at strengthening U.S. supply chains and reducing reliance on overseas production for critical technologies.

HOST: That's a significant development for U.S. manufacturing and technological independence. Speaking of technology, artificial intelligence is a hot topic, and President Trump recently commented on its impact on consumers. What did he say?

REPORTER: In a social media post, President Trump claimed that Microsoft will "make major changes beginning this week" to ensure that Americans do not see rising energy costs due to the power demands of AI buildout. The specifics of these "major changes" and how they will be implemented were not detailed in his post, but it highlights a growing awareness of AI's broader societal impact.

HOST: Interesting. And on the corporate side of AI, we have big news from two tech giants. Apple and Google are teaming up, correct?

REPORTER: That's right. Apple, which had been facing increasing questions about its AI strategy compared to other big tech companies investing tens of billions, is reportedly teaming up with Google for artificial intelligence in its products. This partnership suggests Apple is looking to rapidly integrate advanced AI capabilities, potentially leveraging Google's extensive research and development in the field.

HOST: From global tech to international sports, let's turn our attention to cricket. There have been security concerns for the Bangladesh team playing in India. What's the latest assessment?

REPORTER: The International Cricket Council, or ICC, has completed its security assessment regarding the Bangladesh team playing matches in India. They have stated there is no specific threat to the team. This assessment comes despite ongoing reiterations of security concerns from Bangladesh's sports adviser. So, for now, the matches are expected to proceed as planned.

HOST: Good to hear that security has been confirmed. Now, let’s pivot to some domestic news from India. An NDTV report has uncovered some disturbing allegations about illegal immigration in Mumbai. What can you tell us?

REPORTER: An NDTV investigation has brought to light a concerning situation in Mumbai, suggesting the city is becoming a hub for illegal immigrants. The report details what’s being called the "Malvani pattern," where individuals are allegedly obtaining voter IDs for as little as 30,000 rupees. This issue of illegal infiltration is a significant political flashpoint, particularly in India's border states like Assam, Tripura, and West Bengal, and now it appears to be a problem in major cities as well.

HOST: That's certainly a serious issue requiring attention. Moving to local governance, we have an unusual story from the Nagpur Civic Polls.

REPORTER: Indeed. A woman named Pushpa Waghmare, a mother of four children, has been allowed to contest the Nagpur Municipal Corporation elections. This decision is controversial because, according to existing law, individuals with more than two children are generally prohibited from contesting local body elections in Maharashtra. Her case has sparked debate about the application and interpretation of these rules.

HOST: A fascinating legal and social discussion there. Next, a critical update on a school student rape case from Rajasthan.

REPORTER: Rajasthan police have made a significant breakthrough, detaining an accused from another state in connection with a school student rape case. The incident occurred on January 6th as the girl was on her way to school. The cross-state operation highlights the complexities involved in pursuing such cases and brings hope for justice for the victim.

HOST: And finally, a strong political statement from Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde regarding Mumbai’s status.

REPORTER: Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who recently yielded the driving seat to ally BJP for the Mumbai civic polls, has hit back at the Opposition, particularly the Thackerays' charge. He declared unequivocally that no one can ever separate Mumbai from Maharashtra. This statement reinforces the long-standing political sentiment and unity regarding Mumbai's integral role within the state.

HOST: Powerful words there. Lastly, a unique story that caught our eye from the world of science and animal cognition.

REPORTER: Yes, the renowned Japanese chimpanzee, Ai, sadly passed away at the age of 49. Ai was celebrated for her remarkable cognitive abilities, having been extensively studied since 1977 at a Japanese institute. She was known for her capacity to count and even paint, pushing the boundaries of what we understand about primate intelligence. Her contributions to primatology and cognitive science were immense.

HOST: A truly remarkable life. And that brings us to the end of our Quick News Briefing for today. Before we go, here’s a fun fact for you: Did you know the very first computer mouse, invented in the 1960s by Douglas Engelbart, was made of wood and had only one button? It's a long way from the sleek devices we use today! Thank you for tuning in. From all of us here, have a wonderful evening.
