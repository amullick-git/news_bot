But after reaching 600k monthly users, I hit a ceiling. I couldn't naturally expand beyond DNS because of the domain name.<p>So I went back to the drawing board: how would I make it today? Not as a collection of tools, but as a browsable graph.<p>I've spent hundreds of hours and commits building that. It's not even at 10% of what I want it to be, but more than enough to be useful, and (in my biased opinion) much better than what's out there.<p>Wirewiki launches with DNS lookup, propagation, zone transfer and SPF checking. It also scans the entire IPv4 space for DNS servers and indexes them.\nI'm working on adding more data and tools.<p>I feel like I've developed tunnel vision, so if you see anything that feels off, let me know!<p>I'll keep Wirewiki open and free. Once it has a substantial amount of users, I'll open it up to sponsorship / brand integration from hosting providers, registrars and CDNs, as users will likely be in the market for those. But my goal is to keep Wirewiki free from display ads.

There's a nice way to filter such that you could easily find \"Young Adult, Ancient, Fantasy\" for example.<p>When downloading from the site, the PDFS are rendered in a work queue. Hopefully the server I'm using won't get overwhelmed. It takes around 10-15 seconds to generate for most books.<p>Most of the books currently on the site are from Standard Ebooks. I plan to add more books from Archive.org and Project Gutenberg over time.<p>I also created a little guide on how you can print and bind books at home with around $200 in equipment. (<a href=\"https://printableclassics.com/print-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://printableclassics.com/print-guide</a>)<p>Printable versions of the Harvard Classics are available here: <a href=\"https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics</a> This is an example of direct PDF conversion.<p>Hopefully this is useful to some people. I plan to use the books here for home education myself so it will at least be useful to me. I'd like to add a guide with top suggestions by age level and some educational theory on how I made the selections. I'm happy to take any feedback on the site or answer any questions.<p>There is also the option to have the books professionally printed through a print on demand provider. I'm hoping that could be a way to pay for the site hosting.<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46944365\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46944365</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
