I wanted to test a contradiction: can a ~3B parameter local LLM model complete the flow using only structural page data (DOM) plus deterministic assertions?<p>This post summarizes four runs of the same task (search \u2192 first product \u2192 add to cart \u2192 checkout on Amazon). The key comparison is Demo 0 (cloud baseline) vs Demo 3 (local autonomy); Demos 1\u20132 are intermediate controls.<p>More technical detail (architecture, code excerpts, additional log snippets):<p><a href=\"https://www.sentienceapi.com/blog/verification-layer-amazon-case-study\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sentienceapi.com/blog/verification-layer-amazon-...</a><p>Demo 0 vs Demo 3:<p>Demo 0 (cloud, GLM\u20114.6 + structured snapshots)\n  success: 1/1 run\n  tokens:  19,956  (~43% reduction vs ~35k estimate)\n  time:    ~60,000ms\n  cost:    cloud API (varies)\n  vision:  not required<p>Demo 3 (local, DeepSeek R1 planner + Qwen ~3B executor)\n  success: 7/7 steps (re-run)\n  tokens:  11,114\n  time:    405,740ms\n  cost:    $0.00 incremental (local inference)\n  vision:  not required<p>Latency note: the local stack is slower end-to-end here largely because inference runs on local hardware (Mac Studio with M4); the cloud baseline benefits from hosted inference, but has per-token API cost.<p>Architecture<p>This worked because we changed the control plane and added a verification loop.<p>1) Constrain what the model sees (DOM pruning).\nWe don\u2019t feed the entire DOM or screenshots. We collect raw elements, then run a WASM pass to produce a compact \u201csemantic snapshot\u201d (roles/text/geometry) and prune the rest (often on the order of ~95% of nodes).<p>2) Split reasoning from acting (planner vs executor).<p>Planner (reasoning): DeepSeek R1 (local) generates step intent + what must be true afterward.\nExecutor (action): Qwen ~3B (local) selects concrete DOM actions like CLICK(id) / TYPE(text).\n3) Gate every step with Jest\u2011style verification.\nAfter each action, we assert state changes (URL changed, element exists/doesn\u2019t exist, modal/drawer appeared). If a required assertion fails, the step fails with artifacts and bounded retries.<p>Minimal shape:<p>ok = await runtime.check(\n    exists(\"role=textbox\"),\n    label=\"search_box_visible\",\n    required=True,\n).eventually(timeout_s=10.0, poll_s=0.25, max_snapshot_attempts=3)<p>What changed between \u201cagents that look smart\u201d and agents that work\nTwo examples from the logs:<p>Deterministic override to enforce \u201cfirst result\u201d intent: \u201cExecutor decision \u2026 [override] first_product_link -> CLICK(1022)\u201d<p>Drawer handling that verifies and forces the correct branch: \u201cresult: PASS | add_to_cart_verified_after_drawer\u201d<p>The important point is that these are not post\u2011hoc analytics. They are inline gates: the system either proves it made progress or it stops and recovers.<p>Takeaway\nIf you\u2019re trying to make browser agents reliable, the highest\u2011leverage move isn\u2019t a bigger model. It\u2019s constraining the state space and making success/failure explicit with per-step assertions.<p>Reliability in agents comes from verification (assertions on structured snapshots), not just scaling model size.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706564\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706564</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

I built ChartGPU because I kept hitting the same wall: charting libraries that claim to be \"fast\" but choke past 100K data points.<p>The core insight: Canvas2D is fundamentally CPU-bound. Even WebGL chart libraries still do most computation on the CPU. So I moved everything to the GPU via WebGPU:<p>- LTTB downsampling runs as a compute shader\n- Hit-testing for tooltips/hover is GPU-accelerated\n- Rendering uses instanced draws (one draw call per series)<p>The result: 1M points at 60fps with smooth zoom/pan.<p>Live demo: <a href=\"https://chartgpu.github.io/ChartGPU/examples/million-points/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://chartgpu.github.io/ChartGPU/examples/million-points/</a><p>Currently supports line, area, bar, scatter, pie, and candlestick charts. MIT licensed, available on npm: `npm install chartgpu`<p>Happy to answer questions about WebGPU internals or architecture decisions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706528\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706528</a></p>\n<p>Points: 524</p>\n<p># Comments: 149</p>",
