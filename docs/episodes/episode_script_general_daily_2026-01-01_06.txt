HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily dive into the headlines shaping our world. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, bringing you the latest.

HOST: Arohi, before we jump into today's top stories, let's take a moment for 'On This Day in History'. On January 1st, 1903, Guglielmo Marconi achieved a monumental feat, sending the first successful transatlantic wireless telegraph message. This groundbreaking achievement revolutionized global communication, laying the foundational wires for the interconnected world we navigate today, a legacy that continues to evolve with every technological advancement.

REPORTER: A powerful reminder of how far we've come, Arjav. And speaking of evolution, we have a packed lineup today. From the latest in US politics and a significant court ruling involving presidential authority, to new leadership in New York City and developing international tensions, not to mention a look at how artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and global conflicts. We'll also cover the world's New Year celebrations and some critical updates from India and the world of sports. Our coverage today draws from a wide array of sources, including ESPN Cricinfo.com, Hacker News, US Top News and Analysis, and many others, ensuring a comprehensive view of the day's events.

HOST: Let's start on the domestic front, Arohi, with a significant legal development out of California. President Trump's efforts to control the state's National Guard have been met with a court ruling favoring Governor Gavin Newsom. What are the details here?

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. A federal court has ruled that President Trump must return command of the California National Guard to Governor Newsom. This decision marks a notable victory for Newsom, who has been a vocal opponent of the President's attempts to assert federal control over California's Guard since the summer. The specific circumstances leading to the federal intervention were not fully detailed in the ruling, but the court found that the President’s actions exceeded his authority, reiterating the governor’s role as commander-in-chief of his state’s military forces in peacetime. The ruling emphasizes the balance of power between state and federal authorities regarding the National Guard, particularly concerning domestic operations within a state’s borders. This judicial affirmation restores Newsom's direct operational control, allowing the state to deploy its Guard resources according to local needs and priorities.

HOST: And how does this ruling impact the broader national conversation around federal versus state control, especially concerning the National Guard?

REPORTER: It really reinforces the principle of federalism, Arjav. State governors typically hold primary command over their National Guard units unless they are federalized by the President for specific national missions. This ruling clarifies the boundaries of that presidential authority, particularly when a governor actively opposes the federalization. It’s a legal precedent that could influence future disputes over state resources and autonomy, especially in contexts where federal and state leadership are at odds. It underscores the importance of a clear legal framework for such deployments, ensuring that the Guard remains responsive to both state emergencies and national defense requirements, while respecting established chains of command and constitutional mandates.

HOST: A very important clarification of authority, indeed. Now, shifting to another story with significant implications for families, we're seeing how current immigration policies are affecting some of the most vulnerable. An Afghan family in Oregon is still awaiting reunion with their infant son, three years after fleeing Kabul. What's the latest on their situation?

REPORTER: This is a truly heartbreaking situation, Arjav. The Hashemi family, who settled in Oregon after escaping Kabul, continues to face an agonizing wait to be reunited with their infant son. The latest impediment to their reunion is President Trump's hold on all visas to the United States. The twisting saga began when they were separated from their son during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and despite extensive efforts through various channels, the presidential visa freeze has effectively created a new dead end. The family's plight highlights the broader impact of immigration policy changes on individuals and families, especially those already displaced by conflict. Advocacy groups and legal aid organizations have been working on their behalf, but the current policy has proven to be a formidable barrier, leaving their child in limbo and the parents in a state of prolonged distress.

HOST: It's a difficult situation for many families. Staying in the realm of domestic news, Arohi, let's turn our attention to Minnesota. Congressional Republicans are calling on Governor Tim Walz to testify regarding a fraud scandal. What exactly is happening there?

REPORTER: Governor Tim Walz, who took office in 2019, is under increased pressure, Arjav, as Congressional Republicans have formally requested his testimony concerning widespread fraud scams that occurred on his watch. In recent months, these allegations have escalated, leading to calls for his resignation from certain political factions. The specifics of the fraud involved state-administered programs, though the exact nature and scale are still under investigation. Critics allege insufficient oversight and accountability within state agencies, allowing the fraudulent activities to proliferate. Governor Walz's office has stated its commitment to transparency and cooperation with investigators, but the calls for testimony and resignation underscore the growing political challenges he faces as he navigates these serious accusations.

HOST: Clearly a developing story to watch in Minnesota. Now, let's shift to a major political transition in New York City. Zohran Mamdani has officially been sworn in as mayor. Can you give us the details of this historic moment?

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav, a new chapter has begun for New York City. Zohran Mamdani officially took office as mayor after the New Year's Eve ball drop. The swearing-in ceremony itself was a private affair, held at a unique and symbolic location: a shuttered relic of the city's subway system. This choice of venue, away from the typical grandeur, resonated with his campaign's focus on urban revitalization and addressing the city's foundational challenges. Mamdani's inauguration marks a significant moment, bringing a fresh perspective to the city's leadership at a time of considerable economic and social change. His administration is expected to tackle issues ranging from housing and public safety to education and infrastructure, promising a renewed focus on community-level impact.

HOST: And speaking of education, Arohi, Mamdani has already made a notable decision, reversing his call to end mayoral control of NYC public schools. What prompted this turnaround?

REPORTER: This reversal is indeed a significant development, Arjav. Mayor-elect Mamdani's change of stance on mayoral control of New York City's public schools came as he announced his selection for the critical role of Schools Chancellor: Kamar Samuels. Samuels is a respected figure in urban education, known for his pragmatic approach and experience in navigating complex school systems. The timing of Mamdani's turnaround suggests that his choice of Chancellor, and potentially Samuels' vision for school leadership, played a crucial role in reassessing his initial position. Mayoral control has been a contentious issue in New York City for years, with debates often centering on accountability, equity, and the balance of power between the mayor's office and community input. Mamdani's decision signals a willingness to adapt his policy positions based on new insights and strategic appointments, particularly at this precarious moment for the city's educational landscape as it faces post-pandemic challenges and budget constraints.

HOST: An interesting shift in policy right at the outset of his term. Let's move our focus now to international affairs, Arohi, and a development in the Middle East that has global implications. Tensions between two powerful U.S. allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have erupted into a direct confrontation in Yemen. What can you tell us about this?

REPORTER: This is a concerning development, Arjav, revealing cracks in what has largely been perceived as a united front. Tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have escalated into an unusually direct confrontation in Yemen this week. While both nations are part of the broader coalition fighting the Houthi rebels, their individual strategic objectives and allegiances within Yemen have increasingly diverged. This clash highlights the complex and often competing interests among regional powers, even those aligned with the United States. The implications are significant, potentially fragmenting the anti-Houthi coalition, complicating international peace efforts, and further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Details of the direct confrontation are still emerging, but reports suggest localized military engagements between forces backed by each country.

HOST: That's a critical situation to monitor. Now, on a lighter note, Arohi, the world has just welcomed 2026. What were some of the highlights of the global New Year's celebrations?

REPORTER: From spectacular firework displays to chilly sea dips, countries around the world celebrated the start of 2026 with vibrant shows and long-held traditions, Arjav. Sydney Harbour once again led the global countdown with an iconic fireworks spectacle illuminating the night sky over the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. In Dubai, the Burj Khalifa was the centerpiece of a dazzling light and sound show. European capitals like London and Paris saw massive crowds gather for elaborate pyrotechnic displays and festive events. Many nations also showcased unique cultural traditions, from grand parades in parts of Asia to ancient rituals believed to bring good fortune for the year ahead. Despite varied approaches, a common thread of hope and celebration united people globally as they marked the transition into the new year.

HOST: A beautiful mosaic of celebrations. However, it seems not all New Year's events were peaceful. We're hearing reports of significant violence in the Netherlands. What happened there?

REPORTER: Unfortunately, Arjav, the Netherlands faced what police are describing as "unprecedented" New Year's Eve violence. Widespread reports came in from across the country of fireworks and other explosives being thrown, not just by revelers, but often directly at emergency services personnel. There were multiple incidents involving attacks on police officers, firefighters, and paramedics, leading to injuries and property damage. Authorities struggled to contain the outbreaks in various cities, with some areas experiencing intense clashes. The scale and nature of the aggression have prompted a national discussion about safety measures for future New Year's celebrations and the need for stronger enforcement against those responsible for these acts.

HOST: A concerning turn for what should be a time of celebration. Let's move to some breaking news from South America, Arohi. There's been a head-on train collision near Machu Picchu. What are the reports coming in from that incident?

REPORTER: This is a developing story, Arjav, involving tourists. A passenger on the Machu Picchu train, Niels Honkoop, has described the scene as "chaos" following a head-on collision. He reported that shattered glass littered the carriage floor and injured people were lying in the aisles. Initial reports indicate multiple injuries, though the full extent of the damage and the number of casualties are not yet clear. Emergency services were quickly on the scene, working to assist the injured and secure the area. The famous route to Machu Picchu is a popular tourist destination, and any disruption, particularly an accident of this nature, draws immediate international attention. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the collision, which occurred on a single-track line in rugged terrain, to determine how such an incident could have happened.

HOST: Our thoughts are with those affected. Now, shifting gears dramatically, let's talk about artificial intelligence, which has been a dominant theme this past year. We're seeing how AI tech giants, with billions in debt, are beginning to remake the American landscape with data centers. Arohi, what does this "AI empire" look like?

REPORTER: Arjav, the scale of this transformation is immense. Big Tech companies are aggressively investing in artificial intelligence, and this drive is physically remaking the U.S. map. We're seeing an unprecedented build-out of "kingdom-scale" data centers across the country. These facilities are massive, requiring enormous amounts of land, infrastructure, and crucially, power. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta, along with figures like Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg, are fueling this expansion with billions in debt, driven by a near-religious belief in the necessity of scaling AI capabilities. The sheer power consumption of these data centers is raising concerns about grid stability and environmental impact, and their construction is changing local economies and landscapes, often in rural areas that now find themselves at the forefront of the AI infrastructure boom.

HOST: And the demand for these data centers is so intense, it seems even the sky may not be the limit. There's discussion about the possibility of A.I. data centers in orbit. Is this a serious consideration?

REPORTER: It is indeed, Arjav. Some tech leaders are growing increasingly concerned that the escalating artificial intelligence race will exhaust available land and energy resources here on Earth. The proposed solution? Establishing data centers in orbit. The idea, though futuristic, addresses several critical constraints. In space, issues like land availability become moot, and solar power can be harnessed more efficiently without atmospheric interference. Additionally, the extreme cold of space could provide natural cooling for the massive server farms, significantly reducing energy costs associated with climate control. While the logistical and financial hurdles of launching and maintaining such infrastructure are enormous, the concept highlights the immense, almost insatiable, demand for computational power that the AI revolution is creating, pushing the boundaries of what's considered feasible for technological expansion.

HOST: From Earth to orbit, the infrastructure demands are certainly pushing boundaries. Meanwhile, on another critical front, AI is taking a very different, and quite frightening, turn in Ukraine. Reports suggest an arsenal of killer A.I. drones is being developed in the war against Russia. Can you elaborate?

REPORTER: This is a stark illustration of AI's dual-use nature, Arjav. As the war in Ukraine grinds on, sophisticated Russian defenses have compelled Ukraine to innovate, leading to the development of a new generation of weaponry: semiautonomous killing machines, or AI drones. These drones are designed to operate with a degree of independence, identifying targets and executing attacks with minimal human intervention, or at least operating outside continuous human control in complex environments. This development raises significant ethical questions about autonomous weapons systems, but for Ukraine, it's a strategic necessity to overcome Russian technological advantages and battlefield attrition. The arsenal being built includes drones equipped with advanced computer vision and targeting algorithms, representing a frightening new chapter in modern warfare, where AI plays an increasingly direct role in combat operations.

HOST: A sobering development. Now, let's pivot to the tech giants shaping our daily digital lives. Meta has been under scrutiny for its handling of scam ads, and reports suggest they've made them harder to find rather than removing them. What's the story here?

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. Recent reports indicate that Meta, rather than fully cracking down on the proliferation of scam advertisements on its platforms, has instead worked to make them harder for users to locate or report. This approach suggests a prioritization of ad revenue retention over a complete eradication of fraudulent content. While the company claims to be investing in tools to detect and remove scams, the internal strategies described indicate a more nuanced effort to manage the problem, potentially by making problematic ads less visible to researchers and regulators, without necessarily eliminating them from user feeds. This raises concerns among consumer advocacy groups and users alike, who rely on Meta platforms for information and commerce, and expect a safer digital environment free from deceptive practices.

HOST: An interesting strategy from Meta. On a more positive note for one tech giant, Google just wrapped up its best year on Wall Street since 2009. What fueled this impressive performance?

REPORTER: Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its shares rally significantly in 2025, Arjav, marking its best year on Wall Street since 2009. This resurgence was largely driven by the company's robust response to initial skepticism regarding its position in the artificial intelligence race. Google introduced several new AI products and services throughout the year that successfully excited investors and demonstrated its competitive edge. These innovations spanned various sectors, from enhancements in search and cloud computing to advanced AI models and consumer-facing applications. The market recognized Google's ability to not only keep pace with the rapidly evolving AI landscape but also to innovate and monetize its vast research and development in the field, leading to strong financial performance and renewed investor confidence.

HOST: Clearly, AI has been a major market mover. However, not all companies have ridden the AI wave equally. Eaton's stock, for example, largely sat out the AI boom this year. What's the outlook for them in 2026?

REPORTER: Eaton, a major electrical equipment supplier, found itself on the sidelines of the AI boom in 2025, Arjav. Despite the overall surge in tech and related sectors, the company's financial results this year failed to meet Wall Street's often lofty expectations. While Eaton plays a crucial role in providing power management solutions, including for data centers, its direct exposure or perceived benefit from the immediate AI investment frenzy wasn't reflected in its stock performance. For 2026, analysts suggest that a rally could be sparked by several factors: increased orders related to the continued build-out of AI data centers requiring Eaton's power infrastructure, strategic acquisitions, or a clearer articulation of how Eaton will directly capitalize on the long-term AI electrification trend. Improved guidance and strong execution on project delivery would also be key.

HOST: Now let's turn to some news from India, Arohi. A controversy has erupted in Jammu and Kashmir after a cricketer played a match with a Palestine flag on his helmet. What do we know about this incident?

REPORTER: This incident has certainly garnered significant attention, Arjav. A cricketer named Furqan Bhat sparked controversy during a domestic league match in the Jammu and Kashmir Champions League when he used a Palestinian flag on his helmet. Following this public display, Bhat was summoned by local police. While the specific legal basis for the summons wasn't immediately detailed, the act is viewed within the context of heightened sensitivities around political symbols in the region. Authorities are likely examining whether the display violated any regulations concerning political expression in sports or any public order statutes. The incident underscores the intersection of sports, politics, and international affairs, especially in regions with complex geopolitical dynamics.

HOST: A situation that reflects broader global tensions. Also from India, we hear that 167 Indians in Pakistan are awaiting return despite completing their sentences. What's the update on their situation?

REPORTER: This is a persistent humanitarian issue between the two nations, Arjav. The Indian Centre has confirmed that 167 Indian citizens, who have already completed their prison sentences in Pakistan, are still awaiting repatriation to India. Under the provisions of the bilateral Agreement on Consular Access from 2008, India and Pakistan regularly exchange lists of civil prisoners and fishermen in each other's custody through diplomatic channels. This recent exchange, conducted simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, highlighted the ongoing delay for these individuals. The process of repatriation often involves complex bureaucratic procedures, verification of nationality, and diplomatic clearances from both sides, which can be protracted. Advocacy groups continue to press for swifter action to facilitate their return home.

HOST: A challenging diplomatic situation. Finally, Arohi, for our sports fans, some cricket news from ESPN Cricinfo.com. Australia has announced its T20 World Cup squad. Any surprises or notable inclusions/omissions?

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav, Australia's T20 World Cup squad has been announced, and there are a few interesting points. Connolly has been included in the squad, which is a notable call given his recent form. However, there were some omissions that raised eyebrows: Owen and Dwarshuis will not be part of the team. Key players like Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, and Tim David have all been included, but their fitness will be closely monitored in the coming weeks, as they will need to prove their readiness for the tournament. The selectors are clearly balancing experience with some fresh talent, hoping to build a strong contingent for the highly anticipated tournament.

HOST: Fascinating insights into the squad selection. Thank you, Arohi, for that comprehensive news brief.

REPORTER: Always a pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And before we sign off, here's a unique fact for you. Did you know that the world's first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace, the daughter of the poet Lord Byron? In the mid-19th century, she wrote what is considered the first algorithm specifically designed to be carried out by a machine, long before modern computers even existed, envisioning capabilities far beyond mere calculation.

HOST: That's all for today's News Briefing. Join us again tomorrow for more in-depth coverage and analysis. I'm Arjav. Have a great day!
