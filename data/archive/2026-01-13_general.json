    "summary": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m the creator of SnackBase.<p>I built this because I work in Healthcare and Life Sciences domain and was tired of spending months building the same \"compliant\" infrastructure (Audit Logs, Row-Level Security, PII Masking, Auth) before writing any actual product code.<p>The Problem: Existing BaaS tools (Supabase, Appwrite) are amazing, but they are hard to validate for GxP (FDA regulations) and often force you into a JS/Go ecosystem. I wanted something native to the Python tools I already use.<p>The Solution: SnackBase is a self-hosted Python (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy) backend that includes:<p>Compliance Core: Immutable audit logs with blockchain-style hashing (prev_hash) for integrity.<p>Native Python Hooks: You can write business logic in pure Python (no webhooks or JS runtimes required).<p>Clean Architecture: Strict separation of layers. No business logic in the API routes.<p>The Stack:<p>Python 3.12 + FastAPI<p>SQLAlchemy 2.0 (Async)<p>React 19 (Admin UI)<p>Links:<p>Live Demo: <a href=\"https://demo.snackbase.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://demo.snackbase.dev</a><p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/lalitgehani/snackbase\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/lalitgehani/snackbase</a><p>The demo resets every hour.

The goal was to explore whether a TikTok-like experience can exist as a thin client over an open social protocol, rather than a vertically integrated platform.<p>Things I\u2019d especially love feedback on:<p><pre><code>  - Whether this kind of UX makes sense on top of ATproto\n\n  - Client-only tradeoffs (ranking, discovery, moderation)\n\n  - Protocol limitations I may be missing\n\n  - Any architectural red flags\n</code></pre>\nTestFlight: <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/cVxV1W3g\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://testflight.apple.com/join/cVxV1W3g</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46604067\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46604067</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",
