Dealta replaces reputation with a Nash Equilibrium-based mechanism. We use staked, pseudo-randomly selected \"Brokers\" to physically verify goods. The protocol ensures that honesty is the dominant strategy for all actors via strict payoff matrices. It intended use is preferably trading of mid to high value goods. Nobody expecting a computer, want a box full of stones.<p>What we are releasing: a custom Layer-1 blockchain stack.<p>Full Node: Implements Hybrid Consensus (PoW + PBFT) for instant finality.<p>Integrated Wallet: Native key management and transaction construction for the custom trade opcodes.<p>DB Management: Custom indexing for trade states and dispute evidence.<p>The system is currently in Alpha. I am looking for feedback on the protocol design, the node architecture and collaborators.<p>Code needs polishing, which i will do if people like the project. \nHowever, the project runs, and a testnet will be launched if people take interest in the project.<p>Readme files will be updated as well. Currently they provide a simple guide on how to build the project.<p>Feel free to send an email.

I built CustomPaste because I was frustrated by the binary choice standard clipboard tools give us: either keep all the messy formatting (background colors, huge fonts) or strip everything down to plain text.<p>We all know Ctrl+Shift+V (paste as plain text), but that is often too destructive, it kills hyperlinks, bolding, and lists when I usually just want to normalize the font family (e.g., force Arial 11pt) or remove background colors.<p>I wanted a tool that let me \"strip exactly what I want, and keep exactly what I want.\"<p>The Solution: Instead of a single \"paste\" behavior, the app lets you create reusable \"Recipes\" to define exactly how your text should land in your editor. It intercepts the clipboard, processes the structure locally, and transforms it based on your rules.<p>It offers granular control over:<p><pre><code>    Smart Preservation: You can strip or set specific font families and sizes but specifically preserve bold, italics, and hyperlinks.\n</code></pre>\nStructure: You can preserve tables while stripping the images inside them.<p>Data Cleanup: It can instantly purge duplicate lines, sort lists alphabetically, or flatten extra blank lines.<p>Text Fixes: It cleans up AI-generated artifacts (like \"smart quotes\" or em-dashes) and enforces casing (Title Case, Sentence Case).<p>Privacy & Pricing: The app runs 100% locally on your machine, no cloud processing and no data harvesting. It is a one-time purchase (lifetime license), not a subscription. There is a free trial (first 100 pastes) so you can test if it fits your workflow.<p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the \"Recipe\" approach or any other edge cases you struggle with when pasting text!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>",
