HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily look at the stories shaping our world. I'm Arjav. Today is December 18th, 2025. On this day in 1878, Joseph Swan publicly demonstrated a working electric light bulb, an invention that illuminated the path for countless technological advancements. We're covering a wide array of stories today, drawing from BBC News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many other reputable sources. Arohi, it's great to have you with us. Let's begin with critical international developments in Ukraine. They're significantly ramping up their domestic arms industry. What are the details?

REPORTER: That's right. The BBC has gained exclusive access to a secret Ukrainian factory, now producing new long-range missiles. This move signals a strategic shift towards self-sufficiency, reducing reliance on foreign aid. Ukraine aims to meet its own defense needs by aggressively boosting domestic arms production. The factory operates under intense secrecy, underscoring the critical nature of its work for national security and the country's long-term resilience against aggression.

HOST: A powerful statement of intent. And related to the conflict, a high-profile figure close to President Putin reportedly pushed back against the war and has now resigned.

REPORTER: Dmitri N. Kozak, a confidant who worked with President Putin for three decades, notably quit in September. His associates describe his break with the Russian leader, indicating significant internal dissent at the Kremlin's highest levels. Kozak's departure and accounts from his inner circle suggest deep disagreements over Russia's war in Ukraine, offering a rare glimpse into potential rifts within Putin's inner circle regarding the war's direction.

HOST: Intriguing insights into Kremlin dynamics. Now, to the U.S. and its increasingly strained relationship with Venezuela. We're seeing escalating tensions, particularly concerning a ship blockade order from President Trump.

REPORTER: Venezuela has vehemently denounced President Trump's ship blockade order, labeling it "warmongering threats." This follows the U.S. seizing an oil tanker off Venezuela's coast last week, intensifying pressure on Nicolás Maduro's government. The blockade order is a significant escalation amidst U.S. efforts to economically and politically isolate the Maduro regime. Caracas views these actions as a direct assault on its sovereignty, further exacerbating fraught relations.

HOST: This isn't just political; a deeper economic dimension, specifically surrounding oil, seems to be driving much of this strategy.

REPORTER: Absolutely. Analysts are indeed scrutinizing if Trump's aggressive Venezuela posture is fundamentally about oil. The country holds the world's largest proven oil reserves. U.S. sanctions and actions consistently target Venezuela's oil industry. Trump's claim that Venezuela "stole" U.S. oil fields, which he wants to reclaim, set off a nationalist reaction there, where oil holds mythical status as a national resource and symbol of sovereignty.

HOST: A complex interplay. Shifting to domestic U.S. policy, there's a significant exodus of federal workers under the Trump administration.

REPORTER: By the end of December 2025, over 300,000 federal employees will be out of government. This exodus results from mass firings, buyouts, and heightened uncertainty. NPR highlighted stories of three such workers, giving a human face to this large-scale departure. It's part of broader administrative reforms, raising questions about institutional knowledge loss and long-term impact on government functioning and service delivery.

HOST: A massive shake-up. Another key economic policy dominating the year is tariffs. What's the latest on the U.S. tariff landscape?

REPORTER: Tariffs have been 2025's hot topic, with duties on dozens of key U.S. trading partners now in effect. CNBC provided a full list, illustrating the strategy's breadth. While active, uncertainty remains regarding their future. Businesses grapple with increased costs and disrupted supply chains. The administration views them as protectionist, while critics cite potential harm to consumers and retaliatory measures.

HOST: A policy with widespread implications. Sticking with the administration, there’s a story about a boat strike video Peter Hegseth allegedly doesn't want the public to see.

REPORTER: This involves a "double tap" strike on September 2nd, which the Pentagon is reportedly keeping under wraps. Unlike other publicly released videos of American missiles destroying suspected drug boats, this particular incident is opaque. The New York Times suggests Hegseth, a prominent media figure, wants this video concealed, raising questions about the strike's nature and the lack of transparency.

HOST: Intriguing, warranting scrutiny. Another high-profile departure is Dan Bongino stepping down as FBI deputy director.

REPORTER: That's correct. Dan Bongino, the ex-podcaster, announced his departure as FBI deputy director. President Trump told reporters Bongino "wants to go back to his show." This swift transition back to his media career, rather than a prolonged federal law enforcement tenure, aligns with a pattern of personnel changes across various government departments in this administration.

HOST: Another notable change. And President Trump's Truth Social parent company is making headlines with a surprising new merger.

REPORTER: Yes, an unexpected development. Trump Media & Technology Group, co-owned by President Trump, announced a $6 billion merger with a nuclear fusion firm. The goal is to help develop a "utility-scale fusion power plant." This significant pivot for a social media company into cutting-edge energy technology signals a diversified and ambitious business strategy beyond its initial digital media focus.

HOST: From social media to fusion power – quite a leap. Before we dive into technology, let's take a look at the entertainment world, with a new Avatar film and a deeply moving drama.

REPORTER: A new "Avatar" film is hitting theaters, offering another visual spectacle from James Cameron. But alongside it, a gut-wrenching drama uses real, harrowing recordings of a call for help from Gaza. This profound film offers a stark, unflinching look at conflict, providing a powerful counterpoint to traditional blockbuster fare. Its focus on authenticity aims to create a deeply immersive and impactful narrative experience for audiences.

HOST: A poignant counterpoint indeed. Now, let's shift to the rapidly evolving world of technology, specifically artificial intelligence. In the UK, a watchdog group has made a provocative claim about creating certain apps.

REPORTER: A UK watchdog claims creating encrypted communication apps like Signal or WhatsApp could be deemed "hostile activity." This is significant for privacy advocates. The implication is that tools designed for secure, private communication, widely used globally, could face increased government scrutiny or legal challenge. It signals a potential crackdown on digital privacy tools under the guise of security concerns, raising concerns about balancing national security with individual rights.

HOST: A concerning precedent for digital freedom. And speaking of AI's pitfalls, a school lockdown involved an embarrassing misidentification.

REPORTER: This highlights AI's current limitations. A school locked down after an AI system flagged a "gun," which was actually a clarinet. The Washington Post reported this incident, underscoring challenges of deploying AI in sensitive environments. While AI offers security solutions, its visual recognition can struggle with context, leading to false alarms. It’s a reminder that human oversight remains crucial in these systems.

HOST: AI is far from infallible. But on the flip side, AI is successfully integrating into business. Visa, for instance, reports success with its new AI shopping tool.

REPORTER: Visa announced its new AI shopping tool successfully completed hundreds of transactions in a pilot program launched in April. This demonstrates a practical, beneficial application of AI in enhancing consumer experience, streamlining payments, and offering personalized insights. It shows AI moving beyond experimental phases into tangible, functional roles in financial technology, aiming for more efficient and intelligent transactions.

HOST: Very practical applications. Demand for AI tech is creating huge market opportunities. Micron Technology, for example, is experiencing a significant boost.

REPORTER: Micron stock recently popped 15%, driven by soaring demand for AI memory. The company reports being "more than sold out" of high-bandwidth memory, crucial for AI data centers. Micron anticipates the total market for high-bandwidth memory could reach $100 billion by 2028. This surge underscores AI's enormous economic impact, creating immense value for companies foundational to hardware infrastructure.

HOST: A massive market on the horizon. Beyond corporate giants, individual entrepreneurs are also leveraging AI for growth and social impact, like Giorgos Tsetis of Nutrafol.

REPORTER: Indeed. Giorgos Tsetis, who built Nutrafol into a $3.5 billion brand, now actively invests in AI and backs social causes. His story exemplifies a growing trend: young entrepreneurs achieving wealth early and using family offices for new ventures rather than just preservation. His focus on AI and philanthropy reflects a shift in how next-generation wealth is managed, combining innovation and social responsibility.

HOST: Inspiring. Let's transition now to critical health and economic news. First, growing concern about bird flu making a dangerous leap to humans.

REPORTER: Scientists are issuing stark warnings about the H5N1 bird flu strain potentially making a dangerous leap to humans, which could trigger a global health crisis. BBC reports researchers are intensifying studies into the virus's transmissibility, monitoring avian outbreaks and isolated human cases. The concern is if the virus mutates to allow easy human-to-human transmission, public health implications would be severe.

HOST: A serious and urgent concern. And speaking of health, the healthcare sector is proving to be a surprising engine for the job market, though not without its risks.

REPORTER: That's right. While other job market sectors cool, healthcare remains a significant engine for job growth. However, this reliance poses risks. CNBC points out that if the sector falters due to policy changes, funding, or demand shifts, it could have cascading negative effects on overall employment and economic stability. Its outsized role means vulnerability could translate into broader economic challenges.

HOST: An important economic indicator. And in health policy, major announcements are expected regarding gender-affirming care for young people.

REPORTER: Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to announce comprehensive measures to ban gender-affirming care for minors. A press conference is set for 11 a.m. Thursday. This represents a significant federal policy shift, impacting medical professionals, transgender youth, and their families nationwide. Dr. Oz is also expected to participate, underscoring the high-profile nature and wide-ranging implications of these proposed restrictions.

HOST: A deeply divisive issue with profound implications. Finally, on the economic front, fresh data on consumer prices.

REPORTER: The delayed November consumer price index data shows prices rose at a 2.7% annual rate. This is notably lower than the 3.1% economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated. This softer-than-expected inflation reading signals continued cooling in price pressures, potentially offering relief to consumers and influencing future monetary policy. It provides optimism that inflationary trends might moderate faster than projected.

HOST: A positive note for consumers. Arohi, thank you for breaking down these complex stories. It’s been an incredibly informative briefing.

HOST: And before we go, here's a fascinating fact you might not know: While the concept of artificial intelligence was seriously explored in the 1950s, the term 'robot' itself actually originates from a 1920 Czech play, R.U.R., meaning 'forced labor' or 'serf.' It remarkably predates much of our modern understanding of intelligent machines.

HOST: That's all for today's News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. Join us tomorrow for another look at the stories shaping our world. Until then, have a great rest of your day. I'm Arjav.
