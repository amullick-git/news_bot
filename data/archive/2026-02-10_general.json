    "title": "Show HN: Distr 2.0 \u2013 A year of learning how to ship to customer environments",
    "summary": "<p>A year ago, we launched Distr here to help software vendors manage customer deployments remotely. We had agents that pulled updates, a hub with a GUI, and a lot of assumptions about what on-prem deployment needed.<p>It turned out things get messy when your software is running in places you can't simply SSH into.<p>Over the last year, we\u2019ve also helped modernize a lot of home-baked solutions: bash scripts that email when updates fail, Excel sheets nobody trusts to track customer versions, engineers driving to customer sites to fix things in person, debug sessions over email (\u201ccan you take a screenshot of the logs and send it to me?\u201d), customers with access to internal AWS or GCP registries because there was no better option, and deployments two major versions behind that nobody wants to touch.<p>We waited a year before making our first breaking change, which led to a major SemVer update\u2014but it was eventually necessary. We needed to completely rewrite how we manage customer organizations. In Distr, we differentiate between vendors and customers. A vendor is typically the author of a software / AI application that wants to distribute it to customers. Previously, we had taken a shortcut where every customer was just a single user who owned a deployment. We\u2019ve now introduced customer organizations. Vendors onboard customer organizations onto the platform, and customers own their internal user management, including RBAC. This change obviously broke our API, and although the migration for our cloud customers was smooth, custom solutions built on top of our APIs needed updates.<p>Other notable features we\u2019ve implemented since our first launch:<p>- An OCI container registry built on an adapted version of <a href=\"https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/</a>, directly embedded into our codebase and served via a separate port from a single Docker image. This allows vendors to distribute Docker images and other OCI artifacts if customers want to self-manage deployments.<p>- License Management to restrict which customers can access which applications or artifact versions. Although \u201clicense management\u201d is a broadly used term, the main purpose here is to codify contractual agreements between vendors and customers. In its simplest form, this is time-based access to specific software versions, which vendors can now manage with Distr.<p>- Container logs and metrics you can actually see without SSH access. Internally, we debated whether to use a time-series database or store all logs in Postgres. Although we had to tinker quite a bit with Postgres indexes, it now runs stably.<p>- Secret Management, so database passwords don\u2019t show up in configuration steps or logs.<p>Distr is now used by 200+ vendors, including Fortune 500 companies, across on-prem, GovCloud, AWS, and GCP, spanning health tech, fintech, security, and AI companies. We\u2019ve also started working on our first air-gapped environment.<p>For Distr 3.0, we\u2019re working on native Terraform / OpenTofu and Zarf support to provision and update infrastructure in customers\u2019 cloud accounts and physical environments\u2014empowering vendors to offer BYOC and air-gapped use cases, all from a single platform.<p>Distr is fully open source and self-hostable: <a href=\"https://github.com/distr-sh/distr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/distr-sh/distr</a><p>Docs: <a href=\"https://distr.sh/docs\">https://distr.sh/docs</a><p>We\u2019re YC S24.

    "summary": "<p>Hi HN \u2014 I\u2019m the developer of NetViews, a macOS utility I built because I wanted better visibility into what was actually happening on my wired and wireless networks.<p>I live in the CLI, but for discovery and ongoing monitoring, I kept bouncing between tools, terminals, and mental context switches. I wanted something faster and more visual, without losing technical depth \u2014 so I built a GUI that brings my favorite diagnostics together in one place.<p>About three months ago, I shared an early version here and got a ton of great feedback. I listened: a new name (it was PingStalker), a longer trial, and a lot of new features. Today I\u2019m excited to share NetViews 2.3.<p>NetViews started because I wanted to know if something on the network was scanning my machine. Once I had that, I wanted quick access to core details\u2014external IP, Wi-Fi data, and local topology. Then I wanted more: fast, reliable scans using ARP tables and ICMP.<p>As a Wi-Fi engineer, I couldn\u2019t stop there. I kept adding ways to surface what\u2019s actually going on behind the scenes.<p>Discovery & Scanning:\n* ARP, ICMP, mDNS, and DNS discovery to enumerate every device on your subnet (IP, MAC, vendor, open ports).\n* Fast scans using ARP tables first, then ICMP, to avoid the usual \u201cnmap wait\u201d.<p>Wireless Visibility:\n* Detailed Wi-Fi connection performance and signal data.\n* Visual and audible tools to quickly locate the access point you\u2019re associated with.<p>Monitoring & Timelines:\n* Connection and ping timelines over 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours.\n* Continuous \u201clive ping\u201d monitoring to visualize latency spikes, packet loss, and reconnects.<p>Low-level Traffic (but only what matters):\n* Live capture of DHCP, ARP, 802.1X, LLDP/CDP, ICMP, and off-subnet chatter.\n* mDNS decoded into human-readable output (this took months of deep dives).<p>Under the hood, it\u2019s written in Swift. It uses low-level BSD sockets for ICMP and ARP, Apple\u2019s Network framework for interface enumeration, and selectively wraps existing command-line tools where they\u2019re still the best option. The focus has been on speed and low overhead.<p>I\u2019d love feedback from anyone who builds or uses network diagnostic tools:\n- Does this fill a gap you\u2019ve personally hit on macOS?\n- Are there better approaches to scan speed or event visualization that you\u2019ve used?\n- What diagnostics do you still find yourself dropping to the CLI for?<p>Details and screenshots: <a href=\"https://netviews.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://netviews.app</a>\nThere\u2019s a free trial and paid licenses; I\u2019m funding development directly rather than ads or subscriptions. Licenses include free upgrades.<p>Happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation, Swift APIs, or macOS permission model.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712</a></p>\n<p>Points: 30</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Hi HN,<p>AI agents that can run tools on your machine are powerful for knowledge work, but they\u2019re only as useful as the context they have. Rowboat is an open-source, local-first app that turns your work into a living knowledge graph (stored as plain Markdown with backlinks) and uses it to accomplish tasks on your computer.<p>For example, you can say \"Build me a deck about our next quarter roadmap.\" Rowboat pulls priorities and commitments from your graph, loads a presentation skill, and exports a PDF.<p>Our repo is <a href=\"https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat</a>, and there\u2019s a demo video here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I</a><p>Rowboat has two parts:<p>(1) A living context graph: Rowboat connects to sources like Gmail and meeting notes like Granola and Fireflies, extracts decisions, commitments, deadlines, and relationships, and writes them locally as linked and editable Markdown files (Obsidian-style), organized around people, projects, and topics. As new conversations happen (including voice memos), related notes update automatically. If a deadline changes in a standup, it links back to the original commitment and updates it.<p>(2) A local assistant: On top of that graph, Rowboat includes an agent with local shell access and MCP support, so it can use your existing context to actually do work on your machine. It can act on demand or run scheduled background tasks. Example: \u201cPrep me for my meeting with John and create a short voice brief.\u201d It pulls relevant context from your graph and can generate an audio note via an MCP tool like ElevenLabs.<p>Why not just search transcripts? Passing gigabytes of email, docs, and calls directly to an AI agent is slow and lossy. And search only answers the questions you think to ask. A system that accumulates context over time can track decisions, commitments, and relationships across conversations, and surface patterns you didn't know to look for.<p>Rowboat is Apache-2.0 licensed, works with any LLM (including local ones), and stores all data locally as Markdown you can read, edit, or delete at any time.<p>Our previous startup was acquired by Coinbase, where part of my work involved graph neural networks. We're excited to be working with graph-based systems again. Work memory feels like the missing layer for agents.<p>We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and welcome contributions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46962641\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46962641</a></p>\n<p>Points: 133</p>\n<p># Comments: 32</p>",
