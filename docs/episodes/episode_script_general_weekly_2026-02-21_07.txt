HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to Weekly News Round-up, your essential source for the week's most compelling headlines, delivered with clarity and insight. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi. We have a packed agenda for you today, covering everything from global politics and economic shifts to the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, and a deep dive into India's recent AI Impact Summit.

HOST: Absolutely, Arohi. But first, let's take a quick look back. On this day in history, February 19th, 1878, Thomas Edison was granted a patent for the phonograph, a groundbreaking invention that fundamentally changed how we record and experience sound. It was a true technological disruption, much like some of the innovations we’re discussing today.

REPORTER: A fantastic point, Arjav. It's a reminder of how technology continues to shape our world in profound ways. And speaking of shaping our world, we're bringing you news from top sources including BBC News, NPR, The New York Times, CNBC, NDTV, and many others, to give you a comprehensive picture of the week.

HOST: Let's kick things off with a quick global brief. Arohi, what's making headlines internationally this morning?

REPORTER: Well, Arjav, we're seeing some movement on several fronts. President Trump's Board of Peace is set to convene for its inaugural meeting, a development many are watching closely for its potential impact on international diplomacy. Meanwhile, the latest round of talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine have concluded, reportedly with very little progress, leaving many observers feeling disheartened. On the corporate legal front, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been actively defending his platform in an ongoing social media addiction trial, addressing significant concerns about the impact of digital engagement on user well-being. So, a mix of political maneuvering, ongoing conflict, and corporate accountability dominating the early news cycle.

HOST: Certainly a lot to unpack there, even in a brief summary. From global politics, let's turn our attention to the domestic front, specifically the U.S. economy. The latest figures show some interesting, if not slightly contradictory, trends. Arohi, what can you tell us about the economic performance in the last quarter of 2025 and the overall year?

REPORTER: The U.S. economy presented a mixed picture as 2025 drew to a close, Arjav. Overall, the economy grew 2.2% for the entire year, which is a modest slowdown from the 2.4% seen in 2024 but still represents solid growth. This annual gain was largely fueled by robust consumer spending and healthy business investment, indicating underlying strength. However, the last three months of the year, the fourth quarter, saw a noticeable slowdown. Gross domestic product expanded at a more modest 1.4 percent annual rate, partly attributed to the lingering effects of a government shutdown, which impacted various sectors and consumer confidence. So, solid performance annually, but a softer finish to the year.

HOST: That's a fascinating contrast, Arohi. Solid growth for the year, yet a slowdown at the end. It reminds me of the term "boomcession" we've heard floating around. How does this economic data reconcile with the general sentiment many Americans seem to have about the economy?

REPORTER: It’s a crucial question, Arjav, and the "boomcession" perfectly captures that sentiment. Despite official GDP numbers showing growth, many Americans feel left behind, leading to a sour mood about the economy. This term, a blend of "boom" and "recession," helps explain the disconnect. While the overall economy might be expanding, factors like persistent inflation impacting purchasing power, wage growth not keeping pace with rising costs, and a sense of economic insecurity contribute to this feeling. People are seeing strong corporate profits and low unemployment, but they might not feel that prosperity in their everyday lives, especially when grocery bills and housing costs remain high. It's a perception gap between macroeconomic indicators and individual household experiences.

HOST: A very important distinction, Arohi, highlighting the human element behind the numbers. Now, let's shift gears to a topic that continues to dominate discussions globally: Artificial Intelligence. It's a field brimming with innovation, but also with significant ethical considerations. What's the latest on that front?

REPORTER: AI, indeed, continues to be a generational global technology disruptor, Arjav. James Manyika, Senior Vice President of Research, Labs, Technology & Society at Google, recently articulated this dual imperative perfectly. He emphasized that the drive to develop AI is as vital as the need to be profoundly responsible in its use. It’s a constant balancing act between accelerating innovation and ensuring that this powerful technology serves humanity ethically and safely.

HOST: "Bold and responsible" – a powerful phrase, Arohi. And when we talk about ethical development, specifically in AI chatbots, some companies are taking very deliberate steps. Could you tell us about Anthropic and their approach with Claude?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. Anthropic is one of the world's leading AI firms, and they are keenly focused on infusing ethics into their AI systems, particularly with their chatbot, Claude. New Yorker writer Gideon Lewis-Kraus explored this, detailing how Anthropic is actively working to make Claude more ethical, considering the widening use and implications of AI. This involves rigorous research into areas like "measuring AI agent autonomy in practice." Understanding and quantifying how much independent decision-making an AI system has, and under what conditions, is crucial for building safeguards and ensuring alignment with human values. They are trying to move beyond simply preventing harm to actively embedding principles of safety and beneficial behavior from the ground up, recognizing that as AI agents become more capable, their ethical frameworks become paramount.

HOST: That's a critical area of research. And it’s not just tech firms grappling with these issues; even our legal systems are encountering the complexities of AI. What are we seeing in the courts regarding AI use?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav, the challenges of AI are making their way into the highest echelons of jurisprudence. India's Supreme Court recently flagged the perils of careless AI use, specifically in drafting legal petitions. The court highlighted a case that touched upon "Mercy versus Mankind," underscoring how relying too heavily or thoughtlessly on AI-generated content can introduce errors, ethical ambiguities, or even misrepresent facts, potentially leading to serious implications for justice. This concern isn’t isolated; high courts globally are grappling with how to integrate AI tools responsibly without compromising legal integrity or fairness.

HOST: That's a stark reminder that even in professional fields, human oversight remains indispensable. Speaking of oversight, what about the broader conversation around global governance of AI? It seems there are differing views even among tech leaders.

REPORTER: There certainly are, Arjav. The urgency of tackling AI threats is widely acknowledged, even by tech giants like Google. However, when it comes to to govern AI, opinions diverge significantly. For instance, the head of the U.S. delegation at the recent AI Impact Summit in Delhi made a very clear statement: "We totally reject global governance of AI." This stance suggests a preference for national or perhaps more localized regulatory frameworks, or perhaps a belief that global bodies might stifle innovation. It emphasizes the complex political and economic dimensions of AI regulation, where national interests and competitive advantages often clash with the desire for unified, global standards.

HOST: That's a powerful statement, and it underscores the geopolitical implications of AI development. Now, shifting to a more philosophical plane, the idea of AI consciousness is something that sparks a lot of debate. What are experts saying on that front?

REPORTER: It's a profound question, Arjav, and author Michael Pollan, known for his work on consciousness, has weighed in on this. He suggests that while AI may certainly "think" in complex and sophisticated ways, it will never truly be conscious in the way humans are. In his new book, "A World Appears," Pollan explores consciousness on both a personal and technological level, arguing that human consciousness is "under siege" by the rapid changes in our world. His view implies that the unique subjective experience, sentience, and self-awareness inherent in human consciousness are fundamentally distinct from even the most advanced AI's computational capabilities. He posits that AI can simulate intelligence, but true consciousness remains beyond its reach, for now at least.

HOST: A thought-provoking distinction indeed. From the philosophical to the practical, let’s turn our attention to a major event that put India squarely on the global AI map this past week: the India AI Impact Summit. Arohi, this sounds like a significant gathering. What was the central theme and its importance?

REPORTER: It was, Arjav, a truly monumental event that highlighted India’s burgeoning ambition in the AI space. The AI Impact Summit in Delhi brought together leaders and innovators from across the globe, aiming to solidify India's position in shaping the future of AI. As Raghav Chadha noted, the summit firmly placed India on the global AI map, emphasizing the nation's commitment to harnessing this technology. French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a keynote, followed by remarks from Prime Minister Modi, signaling the high-level international engagement and India's vision of becoming a key player in the AI ecosystem, moving beyond simply being a consumer to a major developer and shaper of AI policies.

HOST: That's a clear statement of intent. And a core part of India's vision seems to be captured by their "AI for All" initiative. Could you elaborate on that, and what the New Delhi Declaration entails?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. The "AI for All" vision is central to India's strategy, aiming to make AI accessible and beneficial to everyone. This commitment was formally underscored by the adoption of the New Delhi Declaration by 88 nations during the summit. The declaration highlights the critical importance of fostering open and accessible AI ecosystems, ensuring that the benefits of AI are not confined to a few, but rather spread widely, empowering individuals and communities. To further scale up this program, India's top research institution, the Indian Council for Social Science Research, or ICSSR, is set to launch a nationwide campaign. This campaign will specifically focus on promoting Artificial Intelligence among young people across the country, aiming to build a future-ready workforce and foster local innovation.

HOST: It sounds like a truly ambitious and inclusive approach. Beyond domestic initiatives, the summit also seems to have been a hub for significant international partnerships. What agreements and collaborations emerged from these high-level discussions?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav, the summit facilitated a flurry of diplomatic and technological exchanges, underscoring AI's role in global cooperation. Prime Minister Modi and Sri Lankan President Disanayaka met, exchanging views on convergences in deploying AI for development, deepening their connectivity push. Germany's Minister, Wildberger, expressed a strong desire to "work with India at full speed on AI," recognizing AI as not just a futuristic tool but a present necessity for Germany. Economic cooperation featured prominently in talks between India and Switzerland, as leaders met to shape global AI rules, highlighting shared interests in responsible innovation. Perhaps most significantly, India and the U.S. unveiled an ambitious AI Pact, building on the principles of the Pax Silica Declaration, signaling a strong bilateral commitment to shaping the global tech order. These partnerships demonstrate India's growing influence and the collaborative spirit needed to navigate the complexities of AI development and governance.

HOST: That's a robust set of international agreements, Arohi. And it's encouraging to hear about initiatives involving young people. How was youth innovation showcased at the summit?

REPORTER: The summit placed a significant emphasis on nurturing the next generation of AI talent, Arjav. A key highlight was the YUVAi, or youth-focused AI challenge, where young innovators aged 13 to 21 showcased their groundbreaking ideas. Seventy finalists from three different AI challenges presented their innovations, with the top 20 finalists for the YUVAi challenge specifically announced during the summit. This initiative is designed to inspire and engage young minds, providing a platform for them to contribute to the future of AI and demonstrate their creativity and problem-solving skills, aligning perfectly with the "AI for All" vision by encouraging grassroots innovation.

HOST: That’s fantastic to see such a focus on the young innovators. Now, with an event of this scale and ambition, were there any logistical challenges or other notable observations?

REPORTER: There were, Arjav. While the summit generated immense buzz and showcased India's aspirations, it wasn't without its growing pains. CNBC reported on "chaos, confusion, and $200 billion dreams," noting that India hosted one of the world's biggest AI events, but it was unfortunately marred by impossible traffic and a lack of organization in certain aspects. However, amidst these logistical hurdles, important discussions still took place. Jeet Adani, for instance, delivered a powerful message, stating that AI will redefine sovereignty, particularly emphasizing that if energy is the fuel, compute is the factory in this new digital era. There was also a mention of a protest by Congress workers during the GPAI Council Meeting, adding a political dimension to the discussions around responsible and inclusive technology. These details paint a picture of an ambitious nation grappling with the scale and complexities of hosting a major global tech event.

HOST: A candid assessment, Arohi. It seems like the summit, despite its challenges, successfully underscored India's intent to be a major player. Moving from international cooperation and national ambition, let’s talk about a more contentious application of AI: in warfare and defense. This is an area with significant ethical and security implications. What's the latest in this domain?

REPORTER: This is an increasingly sensitive and politically charged area, Arjav. The Defense Department and Anthropic are currently at odds over A.I. safety in warfare. Last year, Anthropic, along with AI rivals OpenAI, Google, and xAI, landed significant defense contracts, with Anthropic's being worth $200 million. However, the exact terms and ethical guidelines for deploying AI in future battlefields have become a point of contention. The dispute highlights the intense debate between those who advocate for rapid AI integration for strategic advantage and those who prioritize robust safety protocols and ethical red lines, especially when it comes to autonomous weapons systems. Anthropic, known for its focus on ethical AI, finds itself in a bind as it navigates the commercial opportunities in defense while upholding its core principles.

HOST: A classic dilemma between technological advancement and ethical responsibility. How is India, specifically, viewing the role of AI in its defense strategy?

REPORTER: India is taking a very proactive stance, Arjav. Dr. Chandrika Kaushik, the Chief of DRDO – India’s Defense Research and Development Organisation – recently stated that AI is set to become the backbone of India's future warfare capabilities. This indicates a clear strategic imperative to integrate AI extensively across its defense apparatus, from intelligence gathering and logistics to potentially autonomous systems. The DRDO chief's comments signal a commitment to leveraging AI for national security, emphasizing the need for advanced technological solutions to maintain a strong defense posture in a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape.

HOST: A clear vision for national defense, Arohi. Now, let’s pivot to AI's broader economic impact, looking at how it’s reshaping industries, software, and even the job market. What are we seeing in the business world?

REPORTER: The AI trade is definitely in a fascinating phase, Arjav, with significant moves coming out of China. Alibaba Group, for instance, just unveiled its newest AI model series, Qwen 3.5. What's particularly noteworthy is its focus on new agentic capabilities, meaning the AI is designed to perform more complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. This release signals a ramp-up in competition within China's AI space, as tech giants vie for dominance in developing more sophisticated and practical AI agents that can deeply integrate into various business processes and consumer applications.

HOST: Agentic capabilities – that’s a significant leap. And how are these advancements impacting the traditional software industry, particularly software-as-a-service models?

REPORTER: It’s causing quite a stir, Arjav. The CEO of Mistral, another prominent AI firm, made a bold prediction, stating that more than 50% of enterprise software could eventually switch to AI-driven solutions. This forecast has already led to concerns in the market, with software stocks experiencing sell-offs on fears that AI could significantly eat into the existing Software as a Service, or SaaS, business models. The worry is that if AI can automate or perform tasks traditionally handled by standalone software, it could disrupt established revenue streams and force a fundamental rethinking of how enterprise solutions are delivered and priced.

HOST: Those are serious market implications. And Jim Cramer, a well-known voice in the financial world, has also weighed in on this "puzzling phase" in the AI trade, hasn't he?

REPORTER: He has, Arjav. Jim Cramer, in his Investing Club column, discussed how the AI trade has entered a "puzzling phase," making it difficult to definitively identify the long-term winners. He explored the recent software sell-off, attributing a significant part of the market’s uncertainty to the influence of companies like Anthropic and the broader AI revolution. Investors are grappling with whether AI will augment existing software or fundamentally replace large segments of it, creating an unpredictable landscape for tech valuations and strategies. It's a period of both immense opportunity and significant market anxiety.

HOST: An interesting paradox for investors. And finally, let’s address the elephant in the room for many workers: the impact of AI on jobs, particularly white-collar roles. What's the outlook there?

REPORTER: It's a question on many minds, Arjav, and the consensus seems to be that while AI is incredibly powerful, it's not coming for every white-collar job, at least not yet. A recent New York Times piece explored this, noting that tech workers themselves are increasingly worried that the artificial intelligence they are building could replace them. However, there's also a strong optimistic view that AI will primarily serve as another tool, rather than a wholesale replacement. For roles like coding and software development, AI can automate repetitive tasks, suggest solutions, and accelerate workflows, allowing human workers to focus on higher-level problem-solving, creativity, and strategic thinking. It suggests a future of augmentation rather than outright obsolescence for many, but it certainly necessitates adaptability and upskilling for the workforce.

HOST: That's a reassuring, yet challenging, outlook. Adaptability truly is key in this evolving landscape. Arohi, thank you for that incredibly comprehensive and insightful round-up. It's been a week of significant developments across the globe.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav. Always a lot to cover.

HOST: And before we sign off, here's a surprising fun fact for our listeners: The world's very first industrial robot, named Unimate, began working on a General Motors assembly line in 1961. It performed spot welding tasks, marking a pivotal moment in automation and hinting at the sophisticated AI-driven manufacturing we see today, over six decades later. Just imagine the vision required to pioneer such a concept back then!

HOST: That's all the time we have for this edition of Weekly News Round-up. Thank you for joining us. For Arohi and the entire team, I’m Arjav. Have a great week, and we'll see you back here next time for more news and analysis.
