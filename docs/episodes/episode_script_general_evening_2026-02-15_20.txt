HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi, bringing you the latest from around the globe.

HOST: On this day in history, February 15th, 1946, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, ENIAC, the world’s first general-purpose electronic digital computer, was officially dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania. A monumental step that paved the way for the AI-driven world we dissect today. We’re covering today’s top headlines, drawing from BBC News, Hacker News, NDTV News, NPR Topics, and many other trusted sources. Arohi, let's start with a significant wave of international protest and diplomacy surrounding Iran.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. We've seen hundreds of thousands of people joining Iran protests around the world. Major gatherings were reported in Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto, with smaller, yet significant rallies also taking place in Tel Aviv and Lisbon. These demonstrations highlight widespread global concern and solidarity regarding issues within Iran.

HOST: That's a powerful display of international sentiment. And on the diplomatic front, there's news regarding Iran's nuclear program.

REPORTER: That’s right. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, told the BBC in Tehran that Iran is ready to discuss compromises to reach a nuclear deal. He explicitly stated that the ball was "in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal," signaling a readiness for engagement under specific conditions.

HOST: So, a diplomatic opening there. Moving to another international incident involving the U.S., there’s a report of a tanker being boarded in the Indian Ocean. What can you tell us?

REPORTER: The US has boarded a second tanker in the Indian Ocean, after tracking it all the way from the Caribbean. The vessel, named Veronica III, is accused by the US of violating a "quarantine" on oil shipments originating from Venezuela. This incident underscores ongoing US efforts to enforce sanctions on specific oil trade routes.

HOST: From international waters, let's turn our attention to the U.S. political landscape and its interactions with Europe. We're hearing about U.S. Secretary of State Rubio's recent comments.

REPORTER: Indeed. At the Munich Security Conference, Secretary of State Rubio struck a notably softer tone compared to Vice President JD Vance's address at last year's event. This shift has been met with a mixed reaction among European policymakers, with some welcoming the warmer words, while others remain cautiously optimistic.

HOST: A potentially significant change in diplomatic tone. And how are opposition Democrats responding to current U.S. foreign policy, particularly concerning Europe's anxieties?

REPORTER: Opposition politicians flocked to the same Munich summit to offer an alternative vision to the "America First" agenda. They attempted to reassure Europe, with many stating sentiments like, "Trump will be gone in three years," and using the platform to stake a claim as future party leaders, indicating a clear intent to re-engage with traditional allies.

HOST: This brings us to observations about the current political climate in the U.S. and President Trump himself. What's being reported on that front?

REPORTER: The New York Times has published a piece on President Trump's "relentless self-promotion," suggesting it fosters an "American Cult of Personality." The article details how Trump has engaged in a spree of self-aggrandizement unlike any of his predecessors, fostering a mythologized, superhuman persona and making himself an inescapable force both at home and globally.

HOST: That's a strong assessment of the political dynamics. And speaking of President Trump, there's news regarding former President Obama's response to an AI-generated video.

REPORTER: Yes, former President Obama responded to President Trump sharing a racist AI video depicting him as an ape. In an interview posted on YouTube, Obama expressed concern, stating, "There doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum." This incident highlights the growing issue of deepfakes and AI misuse in political discourse.

HOST: A very concerning development in the digital age. Sticking with the Trump administration's influence, what's the latest on former trade adviser Navarro's comments regarding data centers?

REPORTER: Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has indicated that a future administration may force data center builders, like Meta, to "internalize" costs. His comments come as data centers, crucial for powering artificial intelligence, are increasingly straining electrical grids and driving up utility costs for consumers. This suggests a potential policy shift to address the economic and environmental impact of burgeoning tech infrastructure.

HOST: Shifting gears now to the ongoing fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein files. This story continues to have repercussions. What's the latest?

REPORTER: Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna has publicly stated he’s shaken by what he’s learned from the Epstein files. He suggested that while Epstein’s network may not have known everything, it's hard to deny that many of them knew enough to know better, highlighting a moral and ethical failure among those connected to Epstein.

HOST: And the ripple effects continue to be felt by many high-profile individuals, even years later.

REPORTER: That's absolutely correct. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in a New York City federal jail in 2019, but more than six years later, people are still losing their jobs and reputations because of their past dealings with him. Recent reports mention figures from Goldman Sachs, former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, and even affiliations with Harvard and Yale being impacted, underscoring the enduring stain of his crimes.

HOST: A long shadow indeed. Now, let’s pivot to the world of artificial intelligence, which continues to dominate headlines. India recently hosted a significant AI summit, correct?

REPORTER: That’s right, Arjav. India hosted its AI Impact Summit 2026 at Bharat Mandapam, a massive event where over 2.5 lakh visitors were expected. This summit underscores India's ambition to play a substantial role in shaping the global AI future.

HOST: And with such high ambitions, who were the key figures at this summit?

REPORTER: French President Emmanuel Macron delivered the keynote address, followed by remarks from Prime Minister Modi. The presence of these global leaders highlights the strategic importance India places on AI development and its desire to collaborate with major tech chiefs and nations to influence policy and innovation in the sector.

HOST: Beyond government initiatives, AI also brings its own set of challenges, including intellectual property concerns. We’re hearing about a radio host whose voice was allegedly stolen by a Google tool.

REPORTER: Yes, radio host David Greene claims Google's NotebookLM tool stole his voice. This incident raises significant questions about AI ethics, copyright, and the protection of personal data and unique attributes in the age of generative AI. It's a case that could set precedents for how AI models are trained and how creators are compensated or protected.

HOST: A concerning development for content creators. On a more positive note for AI development, there's news of a significant acquisition or hiring by OpenAI.

REPORTER: Indeed. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced on X that Peter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI. OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent that has surged in popularity recently, and its integration into OpenAI’s ecosystem is expected to further enhance their capabilities and open-source contributions. Steinberger himself confirmed the news in a personal post titled "I'm joining OpenAI," detailing his excitement for the future.

HOST: Fascinating developments across the board, Arohi. Thank you for that comprehensive overview.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And before we sign off, here's a surprising fun fact related to technology and human ingenuity: While we often associate modern computing with the 20th century, the world's first computer programmer was actually Ada Lovelace, in the mid-1800s. The daughter of Lord Byron, she wrote algorithms for Charles Babbage's analytical engine, long before electronic computers even existed, envisioning machines doing far more than just calculations.
