HOST: Good Morning! Welcome to News Briefing, your essential daily update on the stories shaping our world. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, bringing you the headlines.

HOST: Arohi, before we dive into today's top stories, let's start with a quick look back at history. On this day, February 18th, in 1930, the ninth planet, Pluto, was officially discovered by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. A remarkable moment in astronomical exploration.

REPORTER: Absolutely, a fascinating discovery that reshaped our understanding of the solar system, for a time anyway! And speaking of reshaping, we have a packed lineup today covering everything from political battles and digital sovereignty to economic shifts and the latest in AI innovation. We’re pulling insights from BBC News, NDTV, NPR, The New York Times, CNBC, and ESPN Cricinfo, among other leading sources, to give you a comprehensive picture.

HOST: Excellent. Let's kick things off right here in the U.S., Arohi, where voting rights and election strategies are once again at the forefront. Republicans are reportedly pushing for new voting restrictions in Congress. What are the details on this legislative push?

REPORTER: That's right. The G.O.P. is actively pursuing legislation that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote, among other measures. This move is largely seen as aligning with former President Trump's unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. The party is bracing for potential losses in upcoming elections and is pressing to sharply limit voting access in response.

HOST: A significant development with broad implications for future elections. But on the other side of the aisle, Democrats recently secured a surprising victory in a Texas special election. Arohi, what can we learn from this win?

REPORTER: This was a notable win with Taylor Rehmet taking the seat. The shock Democratic victory in Texas is being highlighted as a potential blueprint for the party's success not just there, but in many other traditionally conservative areas. It suggests a strategy that could be replicated to achieve more widespread gains.

HOST: Intriguing. And staying in the political sphere, California is seeing an intensified effort against a proposed wealth tax, particularly with Bernie Sanders' upcoming visit. What are opponents doing?

REPORTER: Opponents of the California wealth tax are stepping up their game. Their latest moves include launching online advertisements specifically tied to Governor Gavin Newsom, initiating a crypto-related push to raise funds for their cause, and even proposing competing ballot measures. They are mobilizing considerable resources ahead of Senator Sanders' engagement.

HOST: Clearly, a highly contested issue. Now, a look back at an important historical moment concerning race and politics. The New York Times published an article revisiting how a stray quote by Jesse Jackson led to a significant rupture between Black and Jewish voters. Can you elaborate on that pivotal moment?

REPORTER: Certainly. The article delves into how a candidate's reference to New York City as "Hymietown" in 1984 became a major turning point. This inflammatory comment not only severely impacted Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign but also significantly eroded a longstanding alliance between Black and Jewish voting blocs, creating a rift that had lasting consequences.

HOST: A moment with deep historical resonance. And on a related note, we must acknowledge the recent passing of Jesse Jackson. Chicagoans are mourning his loss, highlighting his impact on the community.

REPORTER: Indeed. The BBC spoke with residents in Chicago about what the civil rights leader's passing means to a community deeply shaped by his decades of activism. There's a profound sense of gratitude and remembrance for his tireless work and advocacy.

HOST: A true giant in the civil rights movement. Moving back to current political structures, Virginia's redistricting efforts have been a major topic. Now, one of the architects of that process is planning to run for a new seat himself. Who is this?

REPORTER: That's Democratic state lawmaker Dan Helmer. He played a crucial role in bringing redrawn congressional maps before state voters. Now, Helmer has announced his intention to run for one of these newly created seats himself, making a direct transition from shaping the maps to competing under them.

HOST: From architect to candidate – a direct pivot. Shifting gears, let's look at the global geopolitical landscape. European governments are accelerating their push for digital sovereignty, Arohi, citing national survival. What's driving this urgency?

REPORTER: The move comes amidst heightened geopolitical tensions and a growing strain in Europe's relationship with the Donald Trump administration. The region's extensive reliance on U.S. digital systems and infrastructure has come under intense scrutiny, prompting governments to prioritize and accelerate their efforts to achieve greater digital independence. They view it as a critical matter of national survival.

HOST: A clear reflection of changing international dynamics. And on the broader geopolitical front, CNBC reports that high-stakes talks between the U.S. and Iran, as well as Ukraine and Russia negotiations, are very much in focus today. Is there progress in sight?

REPORTER: Geopolitics is indeed the main theme of the day for markets and international observers. While the talks are still underway, there's cautious optimism for progress. All eyes are on these negotiations, as any positive outcome could significantly impact global stability and energy markets.

HOST: Important discussions on multiple fronts. And a quick note on U.S. federal changes, the top DHS spokesperson has resigned her post. Arohi, who is leaving and what do we know?

REPORTER: Tricia McLaughlin, the spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, has announced her resignation. She is stepping down from her role, though further details regarding her departure have not been immediately made public.

HOST: Thank you for that update. Now, let's turn our attention to domestic tech and social media. Stephen Colbert recently made headlines, stating that CBS barred an interview with a Democrat. What’s the story there?

REPORTER: According to Colbert, CBS management prevented an interview with a Democratic political figure from airing on his late-night show. The reasons behind the network's decision have not been fully disclosed, but it's generated considerable buzz within media circles.

HOST: An unusual situation for a prominent late-night program. Speaking of media and politics, Mayor Zohran Mamdani, known for his viral videos during his campaign, is now using that same strategy to govern. How is he doing this?

REPORTER: Mayor Mamdani successfully leveraged social media and viral videos to connect with voters during his campaign. He is now applying that same direct, engaging strategy to connect City Hall to all New Yorkers, aiming to make government more accessible and responsive by using digital platforms to communicate directly with constituents.

HOST: A modern approach to civic engagement. And on the legal side of social media, Mark Zuckerberg faces a jury today. Arohi, what's at stake in this trial?

REPORTER: Mark Zuckerberg is taking the stand in a significant trial. The core issue revolves around whether social media companies, including his platforms, are fueling the teen mental health crisis. This case could have far-reaching implications for how social media platforms are regulated and held accountable.

HOST: A landmark trial for the tech industry. And we have a breaking news item regarding a search and rescue operation. Search teams are scrambling after an avalanche at Lake Tahoe.

REPORTER: That's right. Emergency crews are currently engaged in search and rescue efforts following an avalanche in the Lake Tahoe area. Details are still emerging, but the focus is on locating anyone who might be trapped or injured.

HOST: Our thoughts are with those affected and the rescue teams. Now, let's shift our focus to India, a nation increasingly prominent on the global economic and technological stage. Vijay Mallya's return to India remains uncertain. What's the latest in his case?

REPORTER: Vijay Mallya's lawyer has informed the court that his return to India is uncertain, primarily due to existing travel curbs. Mallya was declared a "fugitive economic offender" by a special court in Mumbai back in 2019, and his extradition and return have been a long-standing point of contention.

HOST: A complex legal battle. On a more positive economic note, India has been signing historic trade deals, putting the nation on a significant global stage. Are there challenges despite this success?

REPORTER: Absolutely. While India has indeed secured a string of landmark trade deals recently, experts emphasize that sustained export growth will necessitate deeper, more comprehensive reforms within the country. The deals are a strong start, but structural changes are still required to fully capitalize on this global positioning.

HOST: A dual picture of progress and potential. India's AI ecosystem is also attracting significant investment. Nvidia is partnering with major Indian VC firms in search of the country's next AI startups. What's Nvidia's strategy here?

REPORTER: Nvidia is betting big on India's burgeoning AI ecosystem. They are expanding partnerships, including with prominent venture capital firms, as part of a strategy to identify and nurture the next wave of AI startups in the country. This move follows substantial investments by other Big Tech players in India's AI landscape.

HOST: High hopes for India's AI future. However, there's also been a notable controversy: an Indian university is facing backlash for claiming a Chinese robodog as its own at an AI summit. What happened?

REPORTER: It appears a professor at the university claimed that a robotic dog, manufactured by the Chinese firm Unitree, was actually developed by their institution. This misrepresentation at a major AI summit has led to significant backlash and scrutiny for the university involved.

HOST: A concerning incident regarding academic integrity. On the broader topic of AI development, Google's James Manyika has weighed in, stressing the need to be both bold and responsible. What's his message?

REPORTER: James Manyika, Google's Senior Vice President of Research, Labs, Tech & Society, emphasized the dual imperative for AI development. He stated that while the push to develop Artificial Intelligence, a generational global technology disruptor, is critical, it is equally important to be responsible and ethical in its use and deployment.

HOST: A crucial balance to strike. And Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also shared his vision for India's trajectory with AI. What did he say?

REPORTER: Sundar Pichai expressed great optimism, stating that India will have an "extraordinary trajectory" with AI. He further underscored Google's commitment by announcing a new Google AI professional certificate program, aiming to equip the Indian workforce with essential AI skills.

HOST: Clearly, India is a significant focus for AI development. Moving to global trade, Japan has reported a surge in exports to a three-year high. Arohi, what's driving this impressive growth?

REPORTER: Japan's exports saw a nearly 17% increase in January, marking their highest growth in over three years. This surge was primarily driven by a significant jump in shipments to China, which rose by a remarkable 32% after a 5.6% increase in December. China remains Japan's largest trading partner.

HOST: A strong indicator for the Japanese economy. Finally, let's turn to sports, specifically international cricket. We have news on Abhishek's form and the Big Bash League. What's the situation with Abhishek's performance?

REPORTER: India opener Abhishek is yet to score a run at the ongoing T20 World Cup, which has naturally drawn attention. However, batting coach Sitanshu Kotak has brushed off concerns, stating that the team "doesn't over-analyse" his form. He attributes it to the high-risk, aggressive style of cricket Abhishek plays.

HOST: A coach backing his player. And intriguing news for cricket fans in India: Cricket Australia is reportedly considering taking the Big Bash League opening match to India. Any details?

REPORTER: Yes, tournament executives from Cricket Australia recently visited Chennai and held meetings with local officials to explore the possibility. While initial discussions are underway, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, or BCCI, will ultimately have the final say on whether the BBL's opening fixture can be hosted in India.

HOST: That would certainly be a treat for Indian cricket fans! Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive updates.

REPORTER: My pleasure.

HOST: And before we wrap up today's News Briefing, here's a fun fact for you: Did you know the term "robot" itself wasn't coined by a scientist or engineer, but by a playwright? It was first introduced in the 1920 Czech play "R.U.R." by Karel Čapek, derived from the word "robota," meaning 'forced labor' or 'drudgery.' Quite the origin story for a word now synonymous with advanced technology and artificial intelligence!

That's all the time we have for today. Thank you for tuning in to News Briefing. I'm Arjav. Have a fantastic day, and we'll be back tomorrow with more headlines.
