HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m Arjav. On this day in history, February 3rd, 1913, the 16th Amendment to the US Constitution was ratified, authorizing the federal income tax, a moment that fundamentally reshaped America’s economic landscape. Today, we cover news from BBC News, NDTV News, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and more. Joining me to dissect these crucial developments is our senior reporter, Arohi. Welcome!

REPORTER: Thanks, Arjav, great to be here.

HOST: Let's dive right into some breaking news out of the United States. We're starting with former President Trump's recent comments on election integrity and state control. Arohi, what's the update?

REPORTER: Former President Trump recently stated that if states cannot run elections "honestly," then "somebody else should take over." These remarks came during an interview with Dan Bongino, clarifying his earlier call for Republicans to "take over the voting." The comments reignite long-standing debates about election oversight and federal versus state authority in electoral processes.

HOST: And speaking of US politics, a key Democratic primary in Texas is facing controversy. What's unfolding there?

REPORTER: The Texas Democratic primary for Senate is grappling with a racial debate that has rattled the race. State Representative James Talarico used the word "mediocre" in connection with a former House member who is Black. This incident has sparked backlash and has serious repercussions for the contested primary, underscoring the sensitive nature of race and representation in American politics.

HOST: Moving from national to local politics, specifically in New York. We're seeing some interesting shifts there, particularly with Mayor Zohran Mamdani's influence. What's the latest?

REPORTER: Indeed. In one of four special legislative elections held on Tuesday, Democratic Socialists of America candidate Diana Moreno won the election for Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s old seat in the New York State Assembly. Backed by Mamdani, Moreno will serve the remainder of his term, highlighting the D.S.A.'s growing influence in New York City politics.

HOST: And Mamdani himself seems to be driving a new mission for a typically pro-business agency in New York.

REPORTER: That's correct. Mayor Mamdani is looking to significantly remake the city’s Economic Development Corporation. A January 2nd memo, obtained by The New York Times, indicates he wants to reorient the agency's focus to address critical issues like affordability and workers’ rights. This proposed shift from its traditional pro-business stance represents a notable change in priorities.

HOST: Turning our attention to matters of justice and immigration. There's a poignant story from Capitol Hill.

REPORTER: Yes, a very emotional one. At a forum on Capitol Hill hosted by congressional Democrats, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen fatally shot by an ICE agent, spoke out. They called on Congress to rein in immigration crackdown tactics, emphasizing the need for reevaluation of enforcement methods and accountability.

HOST: And shifting to another prominent legal story that's back in the headlines: Jeffrey Epstein’s fortune. The beneficiaries of his trust have now been revealed.

REPORTER: The details of Jeffrey Epstein's trust have finally come to light, showing that Epstein wanted most of his money to go to his girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak. His brother and a Harvard math professor were also named as beneficiaries. This offers further insight into Epstein's private affairs and the distribution of his controversial wealth.

HOST: From legal matters to incredible human resilience. We have a truly astonishing story of a 13-year-old boy's heroic act in Australia.

REPORTER: This is an absolutely remarkable story. Austin Applebee, a 13-year-old boy, swam for hours to save his family after they were swept out to sea in Australia. His "superhuman" effort ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings, a testament to incredible courage and presence of mind.

HOST: Moving to international developments, we're hearing about concerns over press freedom in China.

REPORTER: Indeed. Rights groups are reporting that China has detained two journalists, Liu Hu and Wu Yingjiao, reportedly over a corruption report they published. They are said to have exposed corruption by a senior official in Sichuan. This development raises significant concerns about press freedom and the risks journalists face when investigating sensitive topics.

HOST: Now, let's turn our attention to India, where we have a series of significant developments, from social issues to defense technology and pivotal trade agreements. First, a distressing report from Madhya Pradesh.

REPORTER: A truly tragic incident. In the Mauganj district of Madhya Pradesh, a young woman has allegedly ended her life by suicide after enduring months of harassment, threats, and mental torture by a local man. The incident has sent shockwaves through the community, highlighting the urgent need for greater protection and support for victims of harassment.

HOST: That's truly heartbreaking. On a different note, India has made a significant leap in defense technology.

REPORTER: Yes, a major advancement for India's defense capabilities. India has successfully carried out a test of its key Ramjet Missile Technology, effectively joining an elite league of nations with this capability. The launch was monitored by senior scientists from various laboratories of the DRDO, marking a strategic milestone in indigenous missile development.

HOST: And we're seeing a lot of movement on the trade front, particularly between India and the US. What's the latest on this new trade deal?

REPORTER: There’s indeed a flurry of activity. A Trump aide, Greer, indicated that India is set to maintain some agricultural protections in the upcoming trade deal with the US, stating that the Trump administration reached an "understanding and an agreement with the Indians." This comes as Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s Finance Minister, called the new trade deal with the US "good auguring" for India, though she added that the full details of the agreement will be announced soon.

HOST: And this deal seems to have implications for India's energy imports as well.

REPORTER: Absolutely. Karoline Leavitt asserted that India is expected to stop its Russian oil purchases and will instead buy from the US under this new trade deal. She also stated that India has called for further economic cooperation with the US. This potential shift underscores the geopolitical implications of the agreement, diversifying India's energy sources and strengthening strategic ties with the US.

HOST: So, a lot of optimism, but also some caution, I presume?

REPORTER: Precisely. Indian industry has largely welcomed the prospect of lower tariffs under this long-delayed trade deal. However, experts are advising caution against premature celebration until the full details of the agreement are clearer. There's hope, but also a degree of uncertainty as the specifics are yet to be fully disclosed.

HOST: And finally, on the trade front, how are India-China bilateral trade relations faring?

REPORTER: Despite various geopolitical tensions, India-China bilateral trade reached a significant 155 billion dollars in 2025. Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong reported that India's exports to China specifically grew by 9.7 percent, indicating a robust economic exchange between the two nations, even amidst their complex relationship.

HOST: Fascinating and impactful stories from around the globe. Thank you for that comprehensive overview.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: Before we sign off, here's a surprising fact: Did you know the first successful satellite launch by India was in 1975? It was Aryabhata, named after the ancient Indian astronomer, marking India's entry into the space age. That's all for today's Quick News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. Have a great evening.
