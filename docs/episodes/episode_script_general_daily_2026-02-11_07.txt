HOST: Good morning and welcome to News Briefing! I’m Arjav, and joining me as always for the latest headlines is our seasoned reporter, Arohi. Today, February eleventh, we mark a significant day in innovation. On this day in eighteen forty-seven, the visionary inventor Thomas Edison was born. His work would go on to shape modern life in countless ways, from the light bulb to the phonograph. And speaking of shaping our world, we have a packed lineup of stories from across the globe today, drawing from the BBC, NDTV, NPR, The New York Times, CNBC, and other trusted sources.

Let's dive right into the economic landscape, which always has our attention. Arohi, the latest jobs report from the U.S. just came out. What are the key takeaways, and what does it tell us about the broader economic health?

REPORTER: Good morning, Arjav. The U.S. economy saw a surprisingly robust addition of one hundred thirty thousand jobs in January. This pushed the unemployment rate down slightly to four point three percent, a dip from four point four percent in December. While these numbers seem positive at first glance, annual revisions have shown that job growth last year, in two thousand twenty-five, was actually far weaker than initially reported. So, while January was strong, there's a revised backdrop of softer performance from the prior year.

HOST: That's a crucial detail. Looking at the wider economic picture, particularly with upcoming midterm elections, how are tariffs playing into affordability concerns across the states?

REPORTER: New data highlights that states poised for key midterm election battles paid over one hundred thirty-four billion dollars in tariffs during two thousand twenty-five. This significant financial burden is mounting and directly contributes to affordability issues facing consumers. The cumulative impact of these tariffs is becoming a major point of contention and a key talking point heading into the election cycle, intertwining economic policy with political campaigning.

HOST: Clearly, the economy will be a defining issue for many. Now, let’s pivot to international affairs and some complex diplomatic maneuvers. The U.S. has found itself in an interesting position regarding Venezuela’s oil sales. Can you walk us through that?

REPORTER: Absolutely. The U.S. is currently cooperating with a regime in Venezuela that it doesn't officially recognize, specifically concerning oil sales. This unprecedented situation raises significant questions about the future role of the opposition in Venezuela, which the U.S. had previously supported as the legitimate government. It's a pragmatic move to secure oil supply, but one that complicates long-standing diplomatic stances.

HOST: And staying on the theme of U.S. foreign policy in the hemisphere, we also saw a rare gathering of military chiefs in Washington. What was the purpose of that meeting?

REPORTER: Washington hosted dozens of foreign military chiefs from across the Western Hemisphere in a rare gathering. The meeting underscored the potential implications of the current administration’s "Donroe Doctrine," a phrase evocative of historical U.S. foreign policy doctrines, suggesting a renewed focus on regional influence and security. It signals an effort to reassert U.S. leadership and coordination within the Americas.

HOST: This administration has certainly been at the center of several high-profile issues, and the recent revelations from the Epstein files have sent shockwaves globally. What has been the impact of these disclosures?

REPORTER: The documents released by the Trump administration regarding the Epstein case have indeed roiled the world stage. They've led to a cascade of resignations and the threat of legal charges extending far beyond American borders, impacting figures in various countries. The disclosures have reignited scrutiny and accountability on an international scale.

HOST: And on that very topic, there’s been a specific allegation surfacing about the now-president’s prior knowledge of Epstein’s activities. What are the details there?

REPORTER: An ex-police chief has stated that in two thousand six, the now-president allegedly told him "everyone" knew of Epstein's behavior. The claim further suggests the president called police in Florida who were investigating Epstein at the time, reportedly saying "thank goodness you're stopping him." These allegations add another layer to the ongoing public debate surrounding the Epstein case and its high-profile connections.

HOST: Moving to a critical geopolitical front, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with President Trump amidst sensitive nuclear talks with Iran. What is expected from that meeting?

REPORTER: Prime Minister Netanyahu is anticipated to press President Trump to pursue a deal that goes beyond just Iran's nuclear program. He's expected to advocate for a more comprehensive agreement that would also curb Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for various armed groups across the region. This meeting comes at a very critical stage for the ongoing negotiations.

HOST: Before we move away from U.S. politics entirely, there's also news about a former Trump prosecutor making a bid for Congress. Who is this individual and which district are they targeting?

REPORTER: J.P. Cooney, who served as a former top deputy to Special Counsel Jack Smith and led two prosecutions of President Trump, has announced plans to run for Congress. He'll be seeking election as a Democrat in a newly drawn district located in Northern and Central Virginia. This marks a direct transition from a high-profile legal role to the political arena.

HOST: From U.S. politics to international domestic affairs, let’s turn our attention to Australia, where the opposition leader is facing pressure. What's happening there?

REPORTER: Australia's opposition leader, Sussan Ley, the first female Liberal leader, is under increasing pressure following the resignation of a key colleague. This departure has effectively paved the way for a potential leadership challenge against her within the party, signaling internal instability.

HOST: That's a developing story to watch. Now, we have some tragic news from Canada. What can you tell us about the mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge?

REPORTER: It's a truly heartbreaking situation, Arjav. Nine people have been killed and twenty-five injured in mass shootings that occurred at both a school and a home in Tumbler Ridge, a rural community located in western Canada. Authorities are still investigating the full scope of the incident.

HOST: Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. Shifting gears to the world of sports, the Olympics are often a platform for both athletic prowess and, at times, political statements. There’s a Ukrainian sled racer making headlines in this regard.

REPORTER: That's right. Vladyslav Heraskevych, a skeleton sled racer from Ukraine, has stated his intention to wear a helmet honoring Ukrainian athletes killed while defending their country against Russia's full-scale invasion. International Olympic Committee officials, however, have indicated that such a move would violate rules designed to keep political statements out of the Olympics, setting up a potential conflict.

HOST: A poignant situation. Let's move to a curious maritime phenomenon in the English Channel. What are these "ghost ships" and what challenges do they present?

REPORTER: These "ghost ships" refer to vessels operating in the English Channel that are circumventing or flouting international rules, often in the context of oil exports from sanctioned nations. The question for governments is what actions can be taken when countries deliberately bypass these regulations, presenting a complex challenge to maritime law and international enforcement.

HOST: And speaking of international challenges, the BBC has made a notable return to reporting from Tehran, Iran, for the first time since the recent protest crackdown. What are they observing on the ground?

REPORTER: BBC correspondent Lyse Doucet has been reporting from Iran, noting that the pain is still raw after the unprecedented force used to put down the recent anti-government protests. She’s also observed what she describes as the government’s "political reply" to these massive nationwide demonstrations, suggesting a calibrated response following the crackdown. It’s a crucial glimpse into the country’s current state.

HOST: A very important perspective. Looking at political developments in Africa, there’s a bid underway to extend the term of Zimbabwe’s president. Can you elaborate?

REPORTER: A new bill could pave the way for Zimbabwean President Mnangagwa to extend his term in office, which is currently due to end in two thousand twenty-eight. This move is generating significant political discussion and potential controversy within the country as it seeks to alter the existing constitutional limits on presidential terms.

HOST: Let's turn our attention to India now. There's been a notable directive from the top court to the Anti-Terror Agency. What did the Supreme Court say?

REPORTER: The Supreme Court pulled up the National Investigation Agency, or NIA, stating emphatically that "every outburst is not a security threat." The court directed the NIA to submit a status report on their investigation to the Calcutta High Court. This ruling underscores a judicial emphasis on careful distinction between public unrest and genuine national security threats, signaling a push for balanced investigative practices.

HOST: An important clarification from the judiciary. In other political news from India, a new party is emerging in Puducherry. Who is behind it?

REPORTER: Jose Martin, the son of a prominent lottery baron, has launched a new party and announced his intention to contest elections in Puducherry. Martin, who previously had a stint with the BJP, stated he quit that party due to delays over seat allocation. This marks a new entrant into the local political landscape.

HOST: And regarding India’s economic strategy, there’s an opinion piece suggesting new ambitions on trade need to be paired with domestic reform. What's the core argument?

REPORTER: The opinion piece highlights that while an agreement with the United States was negotiated under duress, it aligns with India's recent trade policy shift away from protectionism towards domestic support programs and trade deals. However, it emphasizes that for these new trade ambitions to truly succeed, they must be coupled with significant domestic reforms, indicating hard work lies ahead in policy implementation.

HOST: A critical balance to strike. On a more personal and impactful note, an acid attack survivor in India is fighting for justice and dignity. What is her specific fight?

REPORTER: Malik, an acid attack survivor, has recently petitioned India's top court to include survivors who were forced to ingest acid under the country's disability law. Her brave fight seeks to ensure that these victims receive the same legal recognition and support as those who suffer external acid injuries, striving for greater justice and dignity for a marginalized group.

HOST: And finally, a quick update on the ongoing Parliament Budget Session. What were the highlights from the eleventh day?

REPORTER: On the eleventh day of the Parliament Budget Session, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated the government's continued push on building infrastructure. Additionally, a significant event was Rahul Gandhi addressing the Lok Sabha, contributing to the ongoing debates and discussions surrounding the national budget and various policy matters.
