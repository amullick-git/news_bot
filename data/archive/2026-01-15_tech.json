    "summary": "<p>For the past year I've been working to rethink how AI manages timing in conversation at Tavus. I've spent a lot of time listening to conversations. Today we're announcing the release of Sparrow-1, the most advanced conversational flow model in the world.<p>Some technical details:<p>- Predicts conversational floor ownership, not speech endpoints<p>- Audio-native streaming model, no ASR dependency<p>- Human-timed responses without silence-based delays<p>- Zero interruptions at sub-100ms median latency<p>- In benchmarks Sparrow-1 beats all existing models at real world turn-taking baselines<p>I wrote more about the work here: <a href=\"https://www.tavus.io/post/sparrow-1-human-level-conversational-timing-in-real-time-voice\">https://www.tavus.io/post/sparrow-1-human-level-conversation...</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46619614\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46619614</a></p>\n<p>Points: 87</p>\n<p># Comments: 20</p>",
