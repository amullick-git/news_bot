    "title": "Show HN: Glitchy camera \u2013 a circuit-bent camera simulator in the browser",
    "summary": "<p>Fun little side project I built after learning about circuit bending in cameras for intentional glitch effect. It is browser based camera toy where you \"rewire\" CCD pin pairs, turn knobs to get different glitch artefacts in real time to capture as photos. I had fun learning to simulate different pin modes - channel split, hue/phase shifts, horizontal clock delays, colour kill etc.<p>Here are some photos taken: <a href=\"https://glitchycam.com/gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://glitchycam.com/gallery</a><p>I intentionally leaned towards skeuomorphic design for nostalgia. I miss the days where I'd spend hours making a button to look like a physical button. Here I chose to make it look like a \"good enough\" Teenage Engineering device UI.<p>I tested/used GPT-5.3-Codex to build this from scratch, since there was a lot of hype around it on X. Maybe I wasn\u2019t using it right, but I found it needed a lot of code cleanup at every step and a lot of hand holding along the way. It missed details/nuances and didn't land the skeuomorphic buttons or the interaction polish. It mostly helped with boilerplate where there wasn't much thinking/detailing. It did give a basic starting point for the effect calculations, but didn't really move the needle on the details.<p>Please give it a go and let me know what you think - your photos and video never leave your browser (you can download them if you choose to). Everything is processed locally in your browser (works offline), nothing is uploaded or seen by anyone.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47033954\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47033954</a></p>\n<p>Points: 93</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>",
