HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I'm Arjav. On this day in history, December 31st, back in 1955, General Motors became the first US corporation to make over one billion dollars in a single year, a true landmark in American business. Today, we're diving into a packed slate of global and domestic news, covering everything from international relations and breaking investigations to the latest in tech and market shifts. We're drawing from top sources like BBC News, Hacker News, US Top News and Analysis, and many more to bring you the stories that matter most. Let's get right to it.

HOST: First up, let's look at some significant international developments. What's the latest from Venezuela?

REPORTER: Venezuela is facing increased scrutiny as the number of American citizens detained there continues to rise. This comes amidst the Trump administration's ongoing military and economic campaign targeting President Nicolás Maduro, signaling heightened tensions between the two nations.

HOST: A concerning situation. Moving to the Middle East, we're seeing continued unrest in Iran. Can you give us the details?

REPORTER: Absolutely. Protests have erupted across Iran, largely fueled by the country's troubled economy. The situation intensified recently, with verified video showing crowds attempting to breach a government building in Fasa, highlighting deep-seated public frustration.

HOST: From there, we turn our attention to Hong Kong, where there are grave concerns for a prominent figure.

REPORTER: Indeed. The daughter of jailed Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai has shared alarming news about her father's health. She tells the BBC that his condition in prison is deteriorating, citing issues like rotting teeth and fingernails falling off, raising international human rights concerns.

HOST: We're also tracking a diplomatic spat involving technology transfer. What's happening between China and the Netherlands?

REPORTER: Beijing has accused the Netherlands of making "mistakes" regarding chipmaker Nexperia, escalating a war of words over technology transfer. This highlights growing global tensions around semiconductor technology and national security interests.

HOST: From diplomatic battles to advanced military technology. Ukraine's war against Russia is reportedly spawning a new arsenal.

REPORTER: That's right. As the conflict in Ukraine drags on, sophisticated Russian defenses are pushing Ukraine to rapidly develop a new class of weaponry: semiautonomous killing machines powered by artificial intelligence, marking a significant evolution in modern warfare.

HOST: And speaking of advanced defense, Israel has unveiled a new system.

REPORTER: Israel has officially delivered its first operational high-power laser system, known as "Iron Beam," to the IDF. This groundbreaking anti-drone laser system marks a major leap in defense technology, designed to intercept aerial threats with precision.

HOST: Shifting gears to domestic US politics, we have news regarding Minnesota's Governor Walz.

REPORTER: Governor Tim Walz is under increasing pressure. Congressional Republicans are calling for his testimony regarding fraud scandals that occurred on his watch since he took office in 2019. He has recently faced calls for his resignation.

HOST: And in New York City, a significant policy reversal from the mayor-elect.

REPORTER: New York City's mayor-elect Mamdani has reversed his previous call to end mayoral control of the city's public schools. This turnaround came as he selected Kamar Samuels to lead the school system during what's described as a very precarious moment for education.

HOST: Finally, on the domestic front, an update on a high-profile investigation.

REPORTER: The Department of Justice still has a staggering 5.2 million pages of unclassified records left to review from its Epstein investigations. This comes after President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill requiring their public release by December 19th, increasing public anticipation.

HOST: Moving to a public health matter that’s affecting many. Flu cases are surging across the U.S. What should we know?

HOST: And for those with travel plans, a harrowing account from South America.

REPORTER: A tourist has described "chaos" following a head-on train collision near Machu Picchu in Peru. Niels Honkoop recounted shattered glass littering the carriage floor and injured passengers lying in the aisles, highlighting the dangers of such incidents.

HOST: Now, let's pivot to the world of technology and the markets, starting with a look at the AI boom.

REPORTER: Artificial intelligence labs are actively tackling a significant hurdle: the power problem. As AI models grow in complexity and demand, finding sustainable and efficient energy solutions has become a critical focus for continued innovation and scaling.

HOST: And that AI excitement certainly translated into big gains for some companies this past year.

REPORTER: Absolutely. Google's shares rallied significantly in 2025, marking its best year on Wall Street since 2009. The company successfully addressed skepticism regarding its AI position by releasing new products that genuinely excited investors, solidifying its market standing.

HOST: However, not every player in the tech-adjacent space saw the same rally.

REPORTER: That's right. Electrical equipment supplier Eaton's stock did not participate in the AI boom this year. Their results fell short of Wall Street's lofty expectations, leading analysts to speculate on what might spark a rally for the company in 2026.

HOST: Finally, from the financial world, a prominent investor weighing in on a major stock.

REPORTER: "Big Short" investor Michael Burry has publicly denied shorting Tesla stock. In a social media post, the Scion Asset Management founder directly responded to a user's question, stating emphatically, "I am not short," clarifying his current position.

HOST: That brings us to the end of today's Quick News Briefing. Before we sign off, here's a surprising fact from the world of technology. Did you know that the very first computer mouse, invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964, was actually made of wood? It had two metal wheels for movement and was patented as an "X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System." Quite a humble beginning for a device that's now so ubiquitous in our digital lives. Thank you for joining us. For Arohi and the entire team, I'm Arjav. Have a great evening.
