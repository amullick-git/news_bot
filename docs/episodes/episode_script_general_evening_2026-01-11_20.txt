HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi. We’re here to bring you the top headlines from around the globe, covering a wide range of stories from US politics and international relations to domestic events, cutting-edge technology, and the latest in sports.

HOST: Absolutely. On this day in history, January 11th, back in 2007, Steve Jobs unveiled the very first iPhone, a device that would fundamentally reshape the world of consumer technology and communication. A truly transformative moment! Today, we're covering news from NDTV News, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many others, bringing you a comprehensive look at today's most pressing issues. Let’s dive right in with some significant developments concerning US foreign policy and domestic legal battles. Arohi, President Trump has made some pointed remarks regarding Cuba and Venezuela. What’s the latest there?

REPORTER: That's right. President Trump recently stated that Cuba would "no longer get oil or money" from Venezuela. He urged Havana to "make a deal, before it's too late," though the specifics of what that deal would entail remain unclear. Cuba's president has responded with a stance of defiance, indicating no immediate change in their position. This comes amidst ongoing tensions in the region and follows a broader pattern of the Trump administration's aggressive posture in international relations.

HOST: And speaking of the administration’s approach, there’s been a notable trend emerging from the US appeals courts regarding judges appointed by President Trump.

REPORTER: Indeed. President Trump famously promised to appoint "my judges" to federal courts, and that promise appears to be playing out at the appellate level. An analysis reveals that the appellate judges he appointed have voted overwhelmingly in his favor, with a reported 133 to 12 record. These judges have formed a nearly united front, consistently defending the administration's agenda against legal challenges, signaling a significant impact on the judiciary's balance.

HOST: A powerful statistic illustrating the lasting legacy of judicial appointments. Now, we're seeing an escalation in pressure on the Federal Reserve, with the Justice Department making a move that has Chair Jerome Powell speaking out.

REPORTER: This is a significant development. The Justice Department has issued a subpoena to the Federal Reserve, focusing on Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony regarding the central bank’s headquarters renovation. Powell has publicly described this as part of a broader "pressure campaign" linked to interest rates. This situation has escalated further, with federal prosecutors opening an investigation directly into Powell himself. The inquiry, centered on the D.C. headquarters renovations, signals a new peak in the ongoing clash between President Trump and the Federal Reserve chair, raising concerns about the central bank's independence.

HOST: A remarkable challenge to an institution traditionally seen as insulated from political pressure. Turning our attention to domestic protests, Minneapolis has been the scene of considerable unrest following a recent incident. What can you tell us about the situation there, Arohi?

REPORTER: Minneapolis is indeed facing continued protests, alongside other cities across the US, following the death of Renee Good. Thousands have marched, and dozens have been arrested. The protests are largely directed against ICE. In response to the escalating situation, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has announced plans to deploy hundreds more federal agents to Minneapolis. Noem has characterized Good’s actions as an act of domestic terrorism, a claim that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey publicly disputes, leading to a deepening divide over the response and narrative surrounding the events.

HOST: A very contentious situation on the ground. Shifting gears to a natural disaster, we have news of a tragic incident in Washington State.

REPORTER: Unfortunately, yes. An avalanche in Washington State has claimed the lives of two men. They were part of a group of four skiers in the backcountry near Longs Pass, an area east of Seattle in the Cascade Mountains. The region had experienced heavy snowfall in the week prior, contributing to the dangerous conditions. Rescue operations confirmed the fatalities.

HOST: Our thoughts are with those affected by that tragedy. Moving now to international news, there are widespread protests gripping Iran, with reports of a severe crackdown. What’s the status of the situation?

REPORTER: The situation in Iran is dire. Despite an internet blackout across much of the country, reports are emerging of a significant rise in deadly violence. Protests, initially sparked by severe economic woes and inflation, have rapidly snowballed into a mass movement across the country. In response, Iranian leaders have taken a tough line against the demonstrators, with authorities escalating their crackdown. The government's firm stance and the communication blackouts make it difficult to ascertain the full extent of the unrest, but the humanitarian concerns are growing.

HOST: A deeply concerning development as economic grievances fuel widespread social unrest. We also heard earlier about the Trump administration's approach to Cuba and Venezuela. Is there a broader implication here for global diplomacy?

REPORTER: That's a crucial question being debated in international relations circles. There's a growing discussion, particularly after developments surrounding Venezuela, about whether the world order is shifting away from traditional diplomacy towards a more aggressive, unilateral approach from some nations. Experts like Peter Krause of Boston College have weighed in, noting the Trump administration’s willingness to act unilaterally against other countries. This approach has significant implications for international relations, potentially signaling a redefinition of global engagement and multilateralism.

HOST: An important shift to monitor in the coming months and years. And from Russia, we have an intriguing story about how state efforts are shaping the next generation.

REPORTER: Indeed. A Russian videographer named Pavel Talankin has shed light on how Vladimir Putin's administration is actively shaping the nation's youth. Talankin, formerly a school events coordinator and videographer, kept his camera rolling when Russia overhauled its school curriculum to foster what he describes as "patriotic soldiers." His extensive footage has now been compiled into a documentary film, which has been shortlisted for an Oscar, offering a unique and revealing glimpse into Russia's efforts to instill nationalistic values in its students.

HOST: A fascinating, and perhaps chilling, look behind the curtain. Let's switch gears and head to India, starting with some exciting news from the world of cricket. Arohi, what’s the latest on the pitch?

REPORTER: India has scraped home with a victory after a tense chase against New Zealand. Despite half-centuries from star batsmen Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill, New Zealand struck three times in just 13 balls, dismissing Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, and Shreyas Iyer, giving India a brief but significant scare in their pursuit of 301 runs. It was a close call, but India managed to secure the win. This match also marked the international debut for New Zealand’s Clarke, while Shreyas Iyer returned to play for India for the first time since his injury in October 2025.

HOST: Always thrilling to hear about a nail-biter on the cricket field. Beyond sports, India is making strides in its space program.

REPORTER: Absolutely. India’s trusted workhorse rocket, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, or PSLV, is poised for a dramatic comeback. Following a setback last year, the ISRO spy satellite launch scheduled for today is expected to significantly boost India’s private space ecosystem. This launch underscores India's growing ambitions and capabilities in the global space race, aiming to leverage private sector innovation.

HOST: An exciting time for India's space endeavors. Finally, we have an update on a high-profile legal case in India involving a prominent figure.

REPORTER: Yes, TVK Chief Vijay, who is also a well-known actor, is scheduled to appear before the CBI today in connection with the Karur stampede case. The investigation into this incident has seen multiple legal turns and has attracted considerable public attention, given Vijay’s prominence. His appearance before the Central Bureau of Investigation marks a significant step in the ongoing probe.

HOST: Thank you, Arohi, for that comprehensive round-up of today's news.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And before we go, here's a unique fact for you: Did you know the longest recorded cricket match in history lasted a staggering 12 days? It was a timeless Test match between England and South Africa in 1939, and it was only concluded due to England needing to catch a boat home. That's dedication!

HOST: That's all the time we have for Quick News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. From all of us here, have a good evening.
