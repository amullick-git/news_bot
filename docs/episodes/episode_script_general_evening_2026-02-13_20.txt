HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I am Arjav, and joining me is our reporter Arohi, ready to dive deep into the day's most pressing stories. On this day in history, February 13th, back in 1971, a significant event for our economy and business world unfolded: the NASDAQ stock market began its operations, forever changing how we trade and invest in technology and growth companies. We've got a packed show for you tonight, drawing from a wide range of sources including BBC News, crucial cricket updates from ESPN Cricinfo.com, top news and analysis from the US, and many more, all designed to keep you informed. Let's get right to it.

HOST: Arohi, let's start tonight with some exciting developments in the world of sports, particularly on the international cricket stage where the USA team just made quite a splash.

REPORTER: Absolutely. In a dominant performance, the USA cricket team trounced the Netherlands. Mukkamalla scored a fantastic 79, while Harmeet delivered a stellar four-for, leading the charge. Shubham Ranjane’s unbeaten 48 runs off just 24 balls powered the USA to an impressive 196 total, and the Netherlands simply folded under pressure, managing only 103 in reply.

HOST: A fantastic win for USA cricket! From the pitch to the halfpipe, Olympic athletes constantly seek an edge, and some US snowboarders have unique methods for keeping calm.

REPORTER: They certainly do. It turns out U.S. Olympic snowboarders are psyching themselves up for competition with a fascinating mix of heavy metal and pop music, adorable cat photos, and surprisingly, many on the men's halfpipe team have embraced Qigong, an ancient Chinese mind-body practice. It's a fascinating look into the mental game.

HOST: That's quite the combination! Moving to a more somber note, the intersection of sports and global events shows itself again with a Ukrainian athlete making a powerful statement.

REPORTER: That's right. Ukrainian athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych is using his platform to honor fallen countrymen. His helmet depicts fellow athletes who have been tragically killed since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country. It's a stark reminder of the conflict's human cost.

HOST: A powerful and poignant tribute indeed. And finally, a lighter but no less dramatic sports note from Florida highlights the intensity some bring to their leisure.

REPORTER: You’re referring to the pickleball brawl, I assume. A Florida couple was arrested after a pickleball match at a Port Orange country club devolved into a fight involving about 20 people. They've been banned for life from the club and now face felony battery charges. Pickleball, while popular, can certainly stir up strong emotions.

HOST: From sports to the serious business of Washington. There's a lot happening on the political front, including looming government deadlines and significant nominations. Arohi, let's start with the latest on the potential government shutdown.

REPORTER: The government is indeed set to partially shut down, again. This comes after lawmakers failed to advance a spending bill, meaning DHS funding is set to expire. Amidst this, Gisèle Pelicot also shared her powerful story, highlighting other pressing issues.

HOST: It seems to be a recurring theme, this brinkmanship over government funding. And speaking of the administration, President Trump has been making headlines with some contentious decisions and appointments. Can you walk us through those?

REPORTER: Certainly. President Trump's State Department nominee, Jeremy Carl, faced a rough confirmation hearing but defended his views on "whiteness." The administration also moved to slash over $600 million in CDC grants to four blue states, though a federal judge quickly issued a restraining order. Separately, border czar Tom Homan announced an end to the immigration crackdown in Minnesota. These developments occur as the White House navigates setbacks, despite President Trump touting wins like drug-pricing initiatives and stock market gains.

HOST: A busy time for the administration, to say the least. With midterm elections approaching, the President has also been focusing heavily on voter-related issues. What's the latest on his election strategy?

REPORTER: The President proclaimed he'll implement national voter-ID requirements by November's elections, potentially via executive order. He's reportedly ramping up election attacks as Republicans face potential losses. This stance meets pushback, like in Virginia, where a court allowed Democrats' redistricting vote, potentially helping them win more House seats, though Republicans may still challenge it.

HOST: And how is all of this, particularly the US political climate, being viewed on the global economic stage? We saw an interesting op-ed on that front.

REPORTER: Yes, a recent op-ed argues that with the world in a state of "rupture," too many economic roads are now leading away from the United States and back to China. Unlike China's initial WTO ascension, this shift signals a move away from US influence, marking a significant reordering of global economic power.

HOST: A lot to unpack there on the political and economic fronts. Let's shift gears now to the accelerating world of technology, specifically artificial intelligence, which seems to be impacting everything from finance to culture. Arohi, what's the latest on AI's disruptive potential?

REPORTER: AI's transformation is happening faster than many anticipated, particularly in the financial sector. UBS analyst Matthew Mish noted this disruption could spark a "shock to the system" in credit markets, signaling significant shifts as AI reshapes economic landscapes.

HOST: That's a powerful forecast. And on a different, perhaps more culturally resonant note, AI is also playing a surprising role in India.

REPORTER: Indeed. Artificial intelligence is quietly powering India's cultural renaissance. From the digitization of ancient palm-leaf manuscripts, preserving invaluable heritage, to real-time translation across India's extraordinary linguistic diversity, AI is reshaping how Indians connect with their own heritage and how the world understands India. It's a remarkable application of technology to cultural preservation.

HOST: Fascinating insights into the future of technology and its global impact. Thank you for those updates. Before we sign off tonight, here's a quick, surprising fact for our listeners: Did you know that the first computer mouse, invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964, was made of wood? It was a simple, three-button device that laid the groundwork for the digital interfaces we use every day. That's all the time we have for tonight's Quick News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. From all of us here, have a good night!
