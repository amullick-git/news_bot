What's the latest from the athletes' villages?

REPORTER: It sounds like a vibrant mix of focused preparation and classic Olympic village antics. US Olympic athletes are steadily arriving and settling into their digs for the next couple of weeks across Italy's various host cities.

It’s a classic start to the Olympic experience for many, quickly finding their rhythm both in training and in making themselves at home.

HOST: Moving from sports to global strategy, the US is making significant moves to counter China's dominance in critical minerals. What's the plan unveiled by the White House?

REPORTER: The US has launched an ambitious plan aimed at tackling China's considerable dominance in the critical minerals market. This initiative saw representatives from over 50 countries attending a key event, according to the White House. The goal is clear: diversify global supply chains and reduce reliance on a single nation for these essential resources, which are vital for everything from electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies to advanced defense systems and consumer electronics.

HOST: And this isn't just a domestic strategy; it involves mobilizing allies into a preferential trade bloc. How will this effort to counter China's leverage work in practice?

REPORTER: Exactly. The U.S. is actively calling for and mobilizing its allies to form a preferential trade bloc specifically for critical minerals. This move is a strategic effort to consolidate economic leverage and further counter China's market position, which currently controls much of the world's processing capacity. The aim is to create a more resilient and secure supply network among partner nations, ensuring stable access to these vital materials while potentially setting price floors to stabilize the market for friendly producers.

HOST: In related international news, there was a significant call between President Xi and former President Trump regarding Taiwan. What were the key points Xi conveyed to Trump on this sensitive issue?

REPORTER: President Xi Jinping reportedly emphasized to former President Trump the necessity for the U.S. to be prudent when supplying arms to Taiwan. This call comes amidst a flurry of visits by Western leaders to China in recent months, highlighting the ongoing sensitive geopolitical dynamics in the region. The message underscores China's firm stance on Taiwan, which it views as part of its territory, and its serious concerns over foreign military support to the island, escalating cross-strait tensions.

HOST: Shifting to domestic politics and the upcoming elections, Democrats are employing a new strategy to win back the House. What's their unique approach in deep-red areas?

REPORTER: Democrats are looking to unconventional candidates to challenge in historically deep-red areas, aiming to broaden their electoral map. They are tapping individuals with unusual résumés, such as a Tejano recording star, a smokejumper, and a fourth-generation farmer, to compete in districts long considered inhospitable to the party. This strategy aims to appeal to a wider demographic and potentially flip seats in what's expected to be a pivotal election year for control of Congress.

HOST: And the first House race of this crucial year is already underway in New Jersey. Can you elaborate on the field in that special primary election?

REPORTER: Indeed. Eleven candidates are currently running in a special primary election scheduled for Thursday, vying to fill Governor Mikie Sherrill’s former seat. The field is notably competitive, including a former member of Congress and the former lieutenant governor, signifying the importance of this early contest. This race is seen as an initial test, providing insights into voter sentiment and setting an early tone for the national election landscape.

HOST: Turning to New York politics, Mayor Zohran Mamdani recently endorsed Governor Kathy Hochul for re-election. What's the significance of that endorsement for her campaign?

REPORTER: Mayor Mamdani's support is seen as a significant boost, potentially lending a jolt of progressive energy to Governor Hochul’s campaign. It also further cements their relationship as political allies, showcasing a unified front among certain factions. This endorsement comes at a crucial time for Hochul as she navigates her re-election bid, seeking to consolidate support across different wings of her party and strengthen her position.

HOST: And how has Governor Hochul been improving her prospects in general, especially against potential adversaries within her own party?

REPORTER: Governor Hochul has largely succeeded in fending off most challenges to her re-election, demonstrating effective political maneuvering. However, she still faces a notable challenge from within her own administration: Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado. Her strategy has involved effectively consolidating party support and strategically positioning herself through various policy initiatives, though the contest with Delgado remains a key dynamic in the ongoing Democratic primary campaign.

HOST: Now, let's talk about journalism and media. A new documentary highlights the challenging work of independent Russian journalists covering the Ukraine invasion. What can you tell us about Julia Loktev's film?

REPORTER: Julia Loktev's documentary, titled My Undesirable Friends, provides an intimate and urgent look into the lives of young, independent Russian journalists. It meticulously follows their challenging work covering Putin's invasion of Ukraine, often in a hostile environment where state censorship is severe and freedom of the press is severely restricted. The film reportedly demonstrates how their courageous work becomes "more relevant every day" amidst the conflict, providing crucial alternative narratives.

HOST: From independent journalists to a veteran at The Washington Post. There's news of a long-serving employee being laid off, highlighting broader trends in the media industry.

REPORTER: That's right. Martin Weil, who worked at The Washington Post for an astonishing 60 years, is among the hundreds being laid off, a stark reminder of the ongoing shifts.

His departure highlights the difficult, evolving challenges facing the media, even at esteemed institutions.

HOST: Speaking of information, the CIA's World Factbook, a widely used online resource, is reportedly being sunsetted. What's the impact of this decision to close a comprehensive online resource?

REPORTER: The CIA's decision to sunset the World Factbook marks the closure of a significant online resource that has been utilized globally for comprehensive data on countries. While specific details on the reasons behind this decision are still emerging, its discontinuation will undoubtedly impact researchers, students, and the general public who relied on it for quick, reliable geopolitical and demographic information. It represents a notable shift in how such government-curated data is presented or accessed.

HOST: And on the subject of information, France's recent raid on X, formerly Twitter, signals an escalating trans-Atlantic showdown over social media regulation. What fundamental divide does this illustrate?

REPORTER: This French investigation into Elon Musk’s X clearly underscores a fundamental divide between European and American leaders concerning social media regulation. European nations tend to favor stricter controls, particularly around content moderation, hate speech, and data privacy, viewing social media companies as having significant societal responsibilities. American perspectives often lean more towards free speech principles and less government intervention. The raid highlights the differing legal and philosophical approaches to governing online platforms in a globalized digital landscape.

HOST: Moving to global immigration and politics, there's news about a significant number of Indian nationals deported from the US last year. What are the figures the Centre presented to Parliament?

REPORTER: Yes, according to the Centre's statement to Parliament, over 3,800 Indian nationals were deported from the U.S. in 2025. This figure highlights the ongoing complexities and enforcement efforts within immigration policies between the two nations, touching upon issues like visa overstays and illegal immigration. It's a statistic that often sparks considerable debate and discussion within both Indian and American communities regarding immigration laws and their strict application.

HOST: Turning to Indian domestic politics, Prime Minister Modi has been critical of Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government. What was his recent pointed barb in the Rajya Sabha?

REPORTER: Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently slammed Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi during a session in the Rajya Sabha. He stated that the Delhi government had "drowned in liquor," a sharp and direct criticism. This barb is widely believed to be a strong political attack in reference to the Aam Aadmi Party's controversial liquor policy and ongoing allegations of corruption surrounding its implementation, adding fuel to parliamentary debates.

HOST: And West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also weighed in on budget matters, sharply contrasting her state's interim budget with the Union Budget.

REPORTER: Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee declared West Bengal's interim budget "pro-people," stating it reflected sound fiscal discipline, unlike the Union Budget which she described as "directionless." She also asserted that the Centre owed West Bengal nearly two lakh crore rupees in legitimate dues, a substantial sum. This statement highlights the ongoing financial disputes and political tensions between the state and the central government, with Banerjee advocating strongly for her state's fiscal autonomy and rights.

HOST: Back to the US, the Epstein story continues to resurface. Former President Trump recently commented on it, suggesting America should move on. What was the reaction to his statement?

REPORTER: Former President Trump suggested America should "move on" from the Epstein saga, implying a desire to close the chapter on the complex case. However, the story is proving resilient, with the Justice Department having concluded its review of related files, yet public and media interest remains exceptionally high. Critics quickly pushed back, arguing that the victims and the broader implications of the case, particularly regarding accountability for those involved, warrant continued attention and investigation, making it difficult to simply "move on.".

HOST: And a new poll reveals significant public disapproval of ICE's immigration enforcement. What are the numbers and the breakdown of public sentiment?

REPORTER: An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll indicates that two-thirds of Americans now believe ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has "gone too far" in its immigration enforcement practices. This marks a notable jump in disapproval, particularly among Democrats and independents, reflecting growing discomfort with current policies. While Republicans largely stand by ICE and the current administration's approach, the overall sentiment points to increasing public concern over the agency's methods and the human impact of its operations.

HOST: Finally, across the Atlantic, the UK's massive research fund is facing "hard decisions," including pausing new grants. What's behind this strategic shift for UK Research and Innovation?

REPORTER: UK Research and Innovation, which manages a significant £8 billion research fund, is indeed facing "hard decisions" as it pauses new grants, signaling a strategic recalibration. Ian Chapman, the UKRI boss, stated that the government had instructed them to "focus and do fewer things better." This indicates a shift towards prioritizing existing, high-impact projects over new initiatives and could reflect budgetary constraints or a re-evaluation of national research priorities in the country's science landscape.
