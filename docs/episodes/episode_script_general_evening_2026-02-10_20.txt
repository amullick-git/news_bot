HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m your host, Arjav. On this day in history, February 10th, 1962, a pivotal moment in Cold War diplomacy unfolded as American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was exchanged for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in a dramatic prisoner swap at the Glienicke Bridge. Today, we delve into a series of impactful stories from around the globe, covering crucial developments in technology, international relations, US politics, and economic shifts. We’re drawing on reports from BBC News, Hacker News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, CNBC, NDTV, and others to bring you the most essential updates. Joining me to dissect these top headlines is our seasoned reporter, Arohi. Welcome.

REPORTER: Thanks, Arjav. It's great to be here to unpack these significant developments.

HOST: Let's jump right into a story that touches on corporate ethics and social responsibility. Salesforce, a major tech company, is facing pressure from its own employees regarding potential business with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. What are the details here?

REPORTER: More than 1,400 Salesforce employees have collectively signed a letter urging CEO Marc Benioff to sever all potential business ties with ICE. This action reflects a growing trend of employee activism within tech giants, where staff are increasingly vocal about the ethical implications of their company's clients and projects. They want Salesforce to align its business practices more closely with stated corporate values.

HOST: That's a powerful statement from within the company. And this isn't happening in a vacuum; the broader context of immigration enforcement is certainly making headlines. We also saw an important House oversight hearing on immigration recently. What were the key takeaways from that?

REPORTER: The House immigration oversight hearing starkly highlighted the deep partisan divisions that continue to plague any efforts at comprehensive immigration reform in the U.S. Republicans and Democrats remain fundamentally at odds over enforcement strategies and policy changes, especially in the wake of recent tragic shootings involving U.S. citizens. The hearing essentially underscored the legislative gridlock on this complex issue.

HOST: Moving on to US politics, a significant development out of Georgia regarding the 2020 election. It seems an inquiry into ballots in Fulton County had a surprising origin. What can you tell us about that?

REPORTER: Indeed. Newly unsealed affidavits reveal that a criminal investigation into the 2020 election in Fulton County, Georgia, was heavily influenced by claims about ballots that have since been widely debunked. This inquiry, including an FBI seizure of ballots, originated with a lawyer who was actively involved in former President Trump's unsuccessful attempts to overturn the election results. The revelations cast a shadow on the basis for that specific investigation, suggesting it relied on unsubstantiated allegations rather than concrete evidence.

HOST: That certainly raises questions about the integrity of the process. Staying in the realm of U.S. politics, there's also news from Congress regarding tariffs. The House recently defeated a Republican bid to block votes on President Trump’s tariffs. What does this mean?

REPORTER: This was a notable moment. Three Republicans broke ranks and joined Democrats to reject a move by GOP leaders. The bid was intended to continue circumventing a law that requires the House to vote promptly on measures challenging presidential tariffs. By defeating this, the House has reaffirmed its legislative oversight role regarding trade policy, potentially paving the way for more direct challenges to tariffs in the future. It’s a small but significant reassertion of congressional authority.

HOST: And another headline tied to former President Trump involves renewed scrutiny of Jeffrey Epstein. What are the latest revelations there?

REPORTER: Newly released documents indicate that a former Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, told the FBI years ago about a 2006 conversation he had with Donald Trump. According to Reiter, Trump allegedly told him back then that "everyone" knew of Epstein's behavior, and that Trump called police to say "thank goodness you're stopping him" during the investigation into Epstein in Florida. This new detail adds to the ongoing public discussion surrounding Epstein's activities and those who knew of them.

HOST: Shifting gears to election news, we have an update from a special primary in New Jersey.

REPORTER: Yes, in New Jersey’s Democratic House special primary, former Congressman Tom Malinowski has conceded to challenger Analilia Mejia. This race, which was initially too close to call, was to fill the seat vacated by New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill. Mejia's win marks a new direction for that primary.

HOST: And on the national legislative front, we’re hearing about a setback for voter ID legislation.

REPORTER: That's right. Senate Leader John Thune has thrown cold water on the prospect of changing the filibuster rules to push through voter-ID legislation, which is strongly backed by President Trump and his Republican allies. This indicates a significant uphill climb for such bills in the Senate, as the existing legislative hurdles, particularly the filibuster, remain firmly in place for controversial measures.

HOST: From political maneuvering to environmental policy, the EPA is reportedly rushing to repeal a significant climate finding. What's behind this push?

REPORTER: The Environmental Protection Agency is indeed moving quickly to repeal a scientific "endangerment finding." This finding is crucial because it legally mandates the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases, essentially requiring it to fight global warming. Experts suggest the agency's accelerated timeline is strategic: the goal appears to be to get the matter before the Supreme Court while President Trump is still in office, potentially securing a favorable ruling that could weaken the EPA's power to combat climate change for years to come.

HOST: Now, let's broaden our view to Europe, where French President Macron is making a strong call for the continent to assert itself more on the global stage.

REPORTER: Macron is urging Europe to begin acting like a true world power, warning about increasing threats not only from traditional rivals like China and Russia but now also from the United States. He described the current geopolitical landscape as a "wake-up call" for Europe, emphasizing the need for greater strategic autonomy and a unified European foreign policy to navigate a more complex and multipolar world.

HOST: And on the economic front in Europe, there's news about a significant shift away from traditional payment networks.

REPORTER: That's correct. Europe appears to be embarking on what's being described as a "24-trillion-dollar breakup" with Visa and Mastercard. This initiative is part of a broader European push to establish its own independent payment systems, aiming to reduce reliance on U.S.-based financial infrastructure, enhance data sovereignty, and potentially lower transaction costs for businesses and consumers across the continent. It’s a bold move with far-reaching economic implications.

HOST: Shifting focus to Asia, India has seen a positive move in its global corruption ranking.

REPORTER: India has climbed five places to reach 91st on the Global Corruption Index for 2025. While still having room for improvement, this upward trend indicates some progress in tackling corruption. For comparison, the US was ranked at the 29th spot, and the UK secured the 20th position.

HOST: And neighboring countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, are facing economic consequences due to ongoing border closures.

REPORTER: The prolonged closure of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border since October has effectively paralyzed trade along a vital route. Both nations are experiencing significant economic losses, with hundreds of trucks stuck at the border, disrupting supply chains and commerce. The situation has been exacerbated by the Taliban's decision to ban all Pakistani pharmaceutical imports to Afghanistan, adding further strain to an already tense economic and political relationship.

HOST: Finally, a rather alarming story about the source of ammunition for Mexican cartels.

REPORTER: This is a significant finding. Mexico's defense secretary has revealed that approximately 137,000 .50-caliber rounds seized from Mexican cartels since 2012 have been traced back to a U.S. Army plant in Kansas City, Missouri. This statistic indicates that nearly half of these high-powered rounds originate from a U.S. military facility, highlighting a concerning pipeline of weaponry feeding into criminal organizations south of the border and raising serious questions about arms trafficking and security protocols.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive summaries and insights. That’s a lot of ground covered.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.
