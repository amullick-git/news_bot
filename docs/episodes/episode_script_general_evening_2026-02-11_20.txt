HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I'm Arjav. On this day, February 11th, in 1997, IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov for the first time in a major tournament, marking a significant milestone in artificial intelligence. Today, we're tracking stories across the globe, from US politics and the economy to international developments and technological breakthroughs. We're drawing our insights from top sources including BBC News, The New York Times, NPR, CNBC, Reuters, and Hacker News, among others. Joining me as always is our lead reporter, Arohi, to break down the headlines. Arohi, let's dive straight into US politics, where the House made a significant move on voter ID legislation.

REPORTER: That's right. The House recently passed a strict voter identification bill. This measure, strongly advocated by some Republicans and amplified by former President Trump's claims of voter fraud, aims to tighten requirements for casting ballots. However, its path forward in the Senate appears blocked. Democrats are expected to filibuster it, and even some Republicans have stated they won't try to skirt those rules to push it through, making its future uncertain.

HOST: So, effectively, a symbolic gesture without immediate legislative impact. And speaking of President Trump, there's also news about his approach to inter-party relations, specifically regarding a governors' meeting.

REPORTER: Indeed. After initially planning to exclude Democrats from an upcoming governors' meeting, President Trump has reversed course and announced he will now invite them. This shift comes even as he continued to criticize a Republican governor who was set to oversee the gathering, highlighting ongoing tensions within the political landscape.

HOST: A change of heart there. And still on the political front, another report has surfaced concerning the financial aspects of holding presidential office.

REPORTER: This report focuses on disclosures that indicate how former President Trump has generated revenue during his presidency. The findings suggest an unprecedented level of financial gain connected to the office, underscoring a continued discussion around ethics in high office.

HOST: Clearly, these are all topics that continue to fuel debate. Now, shifting gears slightly, an AI project is bringing a new dimension to how we perceive Supreme Court proceedings. Tell us more.

REPORTER: It's a fascinating development. An AI project is now creating videos that animate the real words spoken by Supreme Court justices. Traditionally, the reading of Supreme Court opinions is only witnessed by those present in the courtroom. This initiative aims to democratize access, allowing a wider public to see and hear, albeit through AI-generated visuals, the pronouncements of the highest court. It’s an innovative use of technology to enhance transparency and public engagement with the judicial process.

HOST: That certainly sounds like a significant step towards greater public understanding of the Supreme Court. Let's move on to the economy now, where the latest jobs report has brought some unexpected good news for January.

REPORTER: Absolutely. The U.S. economy surprisingly added 130,000 jobs in January, a much stronger performance than anticipated, especially after a weaker than initially reported 2025. This pushed the unemployment rate down slightly to 4.3% from 4.4% in December. This nonfarm payrolls report beat Wall Street expectations, offering a brighter start to the year. However, it’s worth noting that annual revisions showed job growth last year was significantly lower than initially reported, so the overall picture, while improving, still has some complexities.

HOST: So, a positive start to 2026, but with a nuanced backdrop from the previous year. What about other economic indicators, particularly tariffs? We've seen some interesting trends there.

REPORTER: That’s right. Tariff revenue has seen a dramatic increase, soaring by more than 300% in January. This surge in collections contributed to the U.S. government running a smaller deficit compared to a year ago, as the nation awaits a key Supreme Court decision that could impact these trade policies.

HOST: A massive jump. And how are these tariffs impacting states across the country, particularly with midterm elections approaching?

REPORTER: New data reveals that states crucial for upcoming midterm elections accumulated over $134 billion in tariff payments during 2025 alone. This adds to the growing concerns about affordability for consumers and businesses, setting the stage for tariffs to be a major talking point in the upcoming election campaigns, especially given the discourse around the issue led by figures like former President Trump.

HOST: Clearly, tariffs are having a tangible impact at both federal and state levels. And staying on the topic of jobs, there's news about a major player in healthcare education addressing a critical jobs gap.

REPORTER: Yes, Adtalem Global Education, one of the largest healthcare education companies in the U.S., has rebranded itself as Covista. This strategic move, according to the company, signals its renewed ambition to tackle the growing healthcare worker shortage. By aligning its identity with this mission, Covista aims to play a significant role in training and developing the next generation of healthcare professionals.

HOST: That's a crucial effort given the ongoing demand for healthcare workers. Now, let's shift our focus to some significant international developments, starting with a mysterious airspace closure in El Paso. What happened there?

REPORTER: This was a rather unusual situation. El Paso's airspace experienced a sudden and prolonged 10-day closure, reportedly stemming from a dispute over drone technology testing by the US military. Initial speculations ranged from party balloons to cartel drones, but reports point to military testing as the underlying cause, creating significant disruption and raising questions about communication and coordination.

HOST: That's quite a mystery. And moving further afield, we're seeing continued reports out of Iran regarding recent protests and the government's response.

REPORTER: The BBC has been on the ground in Tehran, providing a rare glimpse into the situation following last month's unprecedented crackdown on nationwide anti-government protests. Reporter Lyse Doucet notes that while government-organized rallies for Iran's revolution did take place, they were overshadowed by widespread discontent and defiance among the populace. The reports highlight the government's 'political reply' to the massive protests, but also the enduring underlying tensions.

HOST: A challenging situation indeed. And on a completely different note, some interesting social policy news from Ireland.

REPORTER: Ireland has launched a pioneering basic income scheme specifically for artists. This initiative aims to provide financial stability to creative professionals, allowing them to focus on their artistic endeavors without constant economic pressure. It's an innovative approach to supporting the arts and recognizing the value of creative work within the national economy and culture.

HOST: A unique way to foster creativity. And for our final story, something a little unexpected and historic, literally, from the Navesink River.

REPORTER: Indeed. A long and frigid winter in the Northeast has allowed for a rare event: the renewal of a 135-year-old rivalry on the Navesink River – ice yacht racing. It’s a testament to the enduring appeal of winter sports and the specific conditions required for such a unique spectacle. After years of warmer winters, the Navesink River finally froze solid enough to bring this historic competition back to life.

HOST: What a fantastic tradition to see revived! Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive reports. That brings us to the end of our Quick News Briefing. Before we go, here's a surprising fact: Did you know the world's oldest known continually operating business is not a bank or a restaurant, but a construction company in Japan, Kongo Gumi, founded in 578 AD, which specialized in building Buddhist temples? It’s a remarkable testament to longevity in business. Thank you for tuning in. I'm Arjav, and we look forward to bringing you the news again tomorrow. Good night!
