HOST: Arohi, that was an absolutely comprehensive and incredibly insightful look at a very busy and transformative week in tech! Thank you for breaking down these complex and impactful stories for us with such clarity.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav. It's always a privilege to explore these fascinating developments with you and our listeners.

HOST: Before we sign off, here's a unique and surprising tech fact to ponder. Did you know that the very first documented computer bug wasn't a software glitch in the modern sense, but an actual insect? In 1947, computing pioneer Grace Hopper and her team were working with the Mark II computer at Harvard University when they found a moth trapped in one of its relays, causing a malfunction. They meticulously removed the insect, carefully taping it into the logbook with the entry, "First actual case of bug being found." This literal debugging incident gave rise to the term "bug" that we still universally use today for fixing errors in software and hardware.

REPORTER: That's a classic historical tidbit, Arjav! And a perfect illustration of how innovation often comes with the most unexpected challenges, sometimes even from the natural world.

HOST: Indeed. And with that fascinating piece of history, we wrap up this edition of the Weekly Tech Round-up. Thank you for tuning in and joining us for another deep dive into the innovations shaping our future. We'll be back next week with more breaking news and insightful analysis from the rapidly evolving world of technology. Until then, have a fantastic and tech-savvy week!
