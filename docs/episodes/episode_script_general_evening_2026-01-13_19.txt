HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi.

HOST: On this day in history, January 13th, back in the year 2000, a significant shift in the tech world occurred when Bill Gates stepped down as CEO of Microsoft, handing the reins to Steve Ballmer. A move that would profoundly shape the company's future for years to come. Today, we're diving deep into the latest in technology, economy, and beyond. We'll be covering breaking news from sources like ESPN Cricinfo.com, Hacker News, NDTV News, CNBC, NPR, The New York Times, and many more, bringing you the most important updates shaping our world. Arohi, let's start with a significant story in the AI space, the Federal Trade Commission's recent actions.

REPORTER: That's right. The FTC has accused a company operating hundreds of landing pages for AI-generated answers of "rampant consumer deception." Federal officials allege this operation duped thousands of users who were unable to stop costly monthly charges, marking a serious concern about deceptive practices emerging in the AI services sector.

HOST: That's a stark warning for the burgeoning AI industry. On a more positive note, we're seeing advancements in AI integration in our everyday tools. Slackbot is getting a major upgrade, correct?

REPORTER: Absolutely. Salesforce has announced that Slack is enhancing its personal assistant, Slackbot, by integrating Anthropic's advanced AI model. This upgrade aims to provide users with more sophisticated and helpful generative AI capabilities directly within their workspace, making team collaboration and information retrieval more efficient.

HOST: Fascinating to see AI being applied to enhance productivity. And speaking of practical applications, there's an open-source AI agent making waves for indexing a vast, sensitive dataset. Can you tell us more about the AI agent for the Epstein files?

REPORTER: Indeed. A developer has built and released an open-source AI agent designed to index and search the vast collection of publicly released Epstein files. This tool, encompassing roughly 100 million words, aims to make the messy corpus of PDFs and text files precisely searchable using natural language, providing grounded answers with direct references to source documents. Its goal is to allow for direct exploration of primary sources, bypassing fragmented discussions.

HOST: That's a powerful demonstration of AI's potential for transparency and information accessibility. However, not all AI news is about direct applications or consumer issues. We're also seeing major strategic shifts among tech giants, like Meta's pivot.

REPORTER: Yes, Meta is significantly reallocating resources. The company has begun laying off employees in its Reality Labs division, which focuses on virtual reality, and has closed several VR studios. This move clearly underscores Mark Zuckerberg's massive pivot to prioritize AI development, shifting investment and talent towards artificial intelligence initiatives.

HOST: A clear signal of where the tech giants see the future. But this rapid expansion of AI isn't without its challenges, especially concerning data usage. The issue of "AI scrapers" is becoming a hot topic.

REPORTER: It certainly is. A recent article highlights growing concerns that AI scrapers are making it difficult for online platforms and content creators. The piece titled "We can't have nice things because of AI scrapers" suggests that automated data collection by AI models is creating sustainability issues for services and communities that rely on user-generated content, raising questions about fair use and compensation.

HOST: Moving beyond the immediate AI discussion, Microsoft has made a significant pledge regarding energy consumption. What's happening there?

REPORTER: Microsoft has committed to paying more for electricity in certain communities, a move that has drawn public praise. This decision addresses growing concerns that the energy demands of large data centers are contributing to rising electricity costs for local residents, indicating a corporate response to community impact.

HOST: An interesting development demonstrating tech's broader societal footprint. And for those looking to be part of the tech industry, we're seeing continued hiring, particularly in India.

REPORTER: That's right. Sei, a Y Combinator-backed company, is actively seeking a DevOps Engineer. The role is in-office in India, specifically looking for candidates in Chennai or Gurgaon, reflecting the ongoing demand for skilled tech professionals in the region.

HOST: Now, let's turn our attention to the global and domestic economic landscape. India's economic growth has been a consistent highlight. What are the latest updates from there?

REPORTER: India's Chief Economic Adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, recently stated that economic growth itself is the strongest form of financial inclusion. This emphasizes the government's perspective on how broad-based economic expansion directly benefits citizens by creating opportunities and improving living standards.

HOST: And the World Bank seems to concur with this positive outlook for India.

REPORTER: Yes, the World Bank projects India's economy to grow at 7.2 percent, attributing this robust figure to what they describe as "resilient activity." This forecast reinforces India's position as one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, driven by strong domestic demand and investment.

HOST: While India shows strong growth, globally, consumers are still grappling with inflation. What's the latest on wages and the cost of living?

REPORTER: According to analysts, while wages have generally caught up with inflation since 2020, many workers still feel a sense of stagnation. This indicates that while nominal wages have risen, the real purchasing power for everyday necessities may not have provided the anticipated relief, leaving many feeling the pinch of elevated costs.

HOST: And we have more detailed breakdowns on inflation from December 2025, correct?

REPORTER: That's right. The Consumer Price Index remained unchanged in December. While the overall index held steady, the inflation rate for several consumer staples, particularly food and electricity, continues to remain elevated, impacting household budgets disproportionately.

HOST: So, core inflation figures paint a slightly different picture.

REPORTER: Indeed. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core Consumer Price Index showed a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent gain on a monthly basis. Annually, the core CPI rose at a 2.6 percent rate, which was less than economists had expected, suggesting some moderation in underlying price pressures.

HOST: Shifting to the markets, Tuesday saw a significant rout for software stocks. How did some portfolio names manage to stave off the decline?

REPORTER: In a challenging trading day for the software sector, certain portfolio names managed to buck the trend. Analysis from an Investing Club update highlighted specific strategies or underlying strengths that allowed these companies to avoid the broader market downturn, providing valuable insights for investors in the tech space.

HOST: And finally, let's round off with some international cricket news, starting with the Women's Premier League.

REPORTER: Yes, the Women's Premier League is heating up. We're looking forward to an interesting match where Lanning will be facing her former team as DC and UPW both search for their first win of the season. Despite having a strong lineup on paper, UPW's all-international bowling attack hasn't performed as expected so far.

HOST: And over in the men's international series, India is looking to secure a series win.

REPORTER: That's correct. India has halted New Zealand's winning run and is now eyeing the series spoils. A key question for the team is who will replace the injured Washington Sundar, with Nitish Reddy or Ayush Badoni being the likely contenders to step into that crucial role.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive updates. Before we sign off, here's a unique and surprising fact for our listeners. Did you know the longest cricket match ever played took place in 1939 between England and South Africa and lasted for an astonishing 12 days? The game ultimately ended in a draw, not because of a lack of play, but because the English team had to catch their boat home! What a way to end a series. That's all the time we have for Quick News Briefing tonight. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi.

HOST: We hope you join us again tomorrow for more of the day's top stories. Good night!
