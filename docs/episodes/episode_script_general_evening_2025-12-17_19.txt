HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I'm Arjav. Today, December 17th, we bring you the top headlines from around the globe. On this day in history, in 1903, the Wright brothers made their first successful flight, ushering in the age of aviation and transforming how we connect globally – a perfect parallel to today's news landscape, isn't it? We’re covering a wide range of stories from BBC News, Hacker News, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many others, bringing you concise summaries and expert insights. Joining me, as always, is our brilliant reporter, Arohi, ready to dive deep into the details. Arohi, let's start with some significant political and legal developments dominating headlines in the U.S.

REPORTER: Thanks, Arjav. It's certainly been a busy day on the political front.

HOST: Jack Smith, the former Justice Department special counsel, has been making waves on Capitol Hill. What can you tell us about his closed-door session with Congress?

REPORTER: Absolutely. Smith recently addressed the House Judiciary Committee, defending his prosecutions of former President Trump. He reportedly told them his team amassed "proof beyond a reasonable doubt" that Trump engaged in a criminal scheme aimed at overturning the 2020 election results. This appearance highlights the ongoing legal battles and political tensions surrounding the former president.

HOST: Shifting gears slightly, but still in the political arena, there's been a notable vote in the House regarding military action.

REPORTER: That's right. The House recently rejected a Democratic-led measure that would have barred strikes inside Venezuela. The vote largely followed party lines. This measure was part of a broader effort, alongside another resolution, to halt the military's escalating campaign of boat attacks. The decision underscores the complexities of foreign policy and military engagement discussions on Capitol Hill.

HOST: And speaking of Venezuela, President Trump's recent comments have certainly stirred up a nationalist reaction there.

REPORTER: Indeed. Trump claimed the U.S. wants to reclaim expropriated oil assets, alleging Venezuela "stole" American oil fields. This statement has ignited a strong nationalist response in Venezuela, where oil holds profound cultural and economic significance, almost a mythical status. The remarks risk escalating diplomatic tensions further.

HOST: From international relations to domestic policy, the U.S. is also looking at changes in citizenship.

REPORTER: That's correct. The U.S. government is seeking to increase denaturalizations, which means revoking the citizenship of some individuals. This policy shift could have significant implications for immigrants and the broader legal framework of citizenship. And on a separate but equally significant domestic note, New York State will now allow terminally ill individuals to legally end their lives, marking a major legislative change in end-of-life care.

HOST: Moving to a different kind of military action, what's the latest on the mysterious boat strike involving Peter Hegseth?

REPORTER: This is an intriguing one. The Pentagon has released numerous video clips showcasing American missiles destroying suspected drug-carrying boats. However, a specific "double tap" strike on September 2nd, which Hegseth was reportedly involved with, remains conspicuously under wraps. There's a clear effort to prevent the public from seeing this particular video, leading to questions about its nature.

HOST: Now, let's turn our attention to the economy and some challenges small businesses are facing. The impact of tariffs is a significant concern.

REPORTER: It certainly is. Many small businesses are struggling under the weight of new tariff costs, resorting to high-interest, even predatory, loans just to cover these expenses. The concern is that even if the Supreme Court eventually rules Trump's tariffs illegal, these businesses could still face years of crippling debt due to the exorbitant interest rates and fees on these loans. It's a tough situation for many entrepreneurs.

HOST: And speaking of the market, artificial intelligence continues to be a driving force, with some interesting developments from Micron.

REPORTER: Micron Technology is forecasting a significant surge in revenue, driven primarily by the sustained high demand for computer memory tailored for AI applications. This demand has sent Micron's shares soaring, up an impressive 168% in 2025 alone, underscoring AI's transformative impact on the semiconductor industry and broader market.

HOST: But not everyone is bullish on all AI-related moves. Jim Cramer had some strong words for Amazon recently.

REPORTER: That's right. CNBC's Jim Cramer publicly criticized Amazon for considering what he described as a "circular AI deal," warning that it was reminiscent of the dot-com bubble's speculative excesses. He stated, "I really respect Amazon, and this shocks me that they're willing to put up with this," highlighting concerns about potentially unsound financial practices in the AI space.

HOST: And in further Amazon AI news, there's been a significant leadership change.

REPORTER: Yes, Rohit Prasad, Amazon's top executive overseeing its artificial general intelligence unit, is set to depart at the end of this year. Peter DeSantis will step into lead the AGI group. This leadership change comes at a pivotal time for Amazon as it continues to heavily invest in and develop its AI capabilities.

HOST: Meanwhile, the AWS CEO has weighed in on the discussion about AI replacing jobs, specifically junior developers.

REPORTER: The AWS CEO recently called the idea of replacing junior developers with AI "one of the dumbest ideas." He emphasized that while AI tools can augment and assist, they cannot fully replicate the learning, problem-solving, and foundational skills developed by human junior developers. It's a strong statement against a common fear in the tech industry.

HOST: And on the innovation front, a new startup called Flick is making waves in AI filmmaking.

REPORTER: Flick, a Y Combinator F25 company, is actively hiring a founding engineer. Their ambitious goal is to build what they describe as "Figma for AI Filmmaking," aiming to create a collaborative, design-oriented platform that harnesses AI to revolutionize how films are produced. It's certainly a space to watch for creative disruption.

HOST: Let's shift now to some global and domestic crime and social stories, starting with a major drug bust in New York.

REPORTER: In East Harlem, federal officials have announced charges against twelve men who, for over three and a half years, allegedly turned the Johnson Houses into an "open drug market." They are accused of extensively selling crack cocaine and fentanyl, saturating the housing project with illegal narcotics, a significant blow to the community.

HOST: Moving to international news, a popular South African DJ has been tragically killed.

REPORTER: Yes, there's been shock in Johannesburg following the shooting death of a popular South African DJ. This tragic incident marks the latest in a troubling string of killings that have plagued the crime-ridden country in recent years, drawing renewed attention to public safety concerns.

HOST: And from Australia, more sad news from a recent tragedy.

REPORTER: A somber funeral has taken place for Rabbi Schlanger, who was tragically killed in the recent Bondi shooting. He was mourned by his community as someone deeply beloved, known for spreading "love and joy." The service was a poignant moment of remembrance for an unspeakable loss.

HOST: Finally, a cultural story that's sparked a significant racism firestorm.

REPORTER: Indeed. Former Miss Universe contestant Sarah Dzafce, representing Finland, has drawn widespread backlash after posting a viral "slanted-eyes" photo. This image has stirred accusations of racism, particularly in East Asia and within her home country, igniting an important conversation about cultural insensitivity and representation.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive updates. That's a lot to process, from national politics to global social issues and the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Before we sign off, here’s a surprising fact that ties into our discussions on technology and human creativity: Did you know that the world's first computer programmer wasn't a man, but a woman named Ada Lovelace? Back in the mid-1800s, she recognized the potential of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine to go beyond mere calculations, foreseeing its ability to manipulate symbols and create music, essentially inventing the concept of computer programming over a century before the first modern computer was built. A true visionary!

And that wraps up our Quick News Briefing for today, December 17th. Thank you for tuning in. We appreciate you making us a part of your evening. For all the latest headlines, remember to join us again tomorrow. From Arohi and myself, Arjav, have a good night.
