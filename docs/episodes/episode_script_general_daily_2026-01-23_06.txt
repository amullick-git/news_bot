HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your essential daily update on the stories shaping our world. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, bringing you the latest. We're covering a wide array of developments today, drawing from the New York Times, BBC News, US Top News and Analysis, CNBC, NPR, and many other trusted sources.

HOST: Absolutely. Before we dive into today’s headlines, let's take a quick look back. On this day in history, January 23rd, 1990, a significant step was taken in the realm of health and technology, as the National Advisory Council on Human Genome Research held its first meeting. This paved the way for the groundbreaking Human Genome Project, which mapped the entire human genetic code, profoundly impacting medicine and biotechnology.

REPORTER: A truly monumental achievement that continues to influence scientific discovery today. And speaking of significant events, we start today with a rapidly evolving political crisis in Minnesota, specifically Minneapolis. The city has become the epicenter of unrest following the tragic death of Renee Macklin Good.

HOST: That's right. The situation has been described as combustible, exposing how several colliding forces have set the stage for this ongoing crisis. What more can you tell us about the developments there?

REPORTER: Well, the shooting of Renee Macklin Good has been the catalyst, bringing to a head simmering tensions. It’s a complex situation, with multiple factors contributing to the intensity, including long-standing community grievances and recent policy decisions. We’re seeing a significant public reaction, with new protest tactics emerging.

HOST: And some of those tactics are quite impactful, aren't they? I understand there's a new form of protest taking hold, coupled with an economic strike.

REPORTER: Indeed. Protesters in Minnesota have called for a pause on economic activity and work to strike against the federal immigration crackdown. This has led to hundreds of Minnesota businesses announcing they won't open their doors today, Friday, in a show of solidarity and protest against ICE. This widespread business strike marks a notable escalation in the ongoing demonstrations.

HOST: That’s a powerful statement from the business community. And beyond the local protests, there's been a development regarding a specific image from the demonstrations. The White House posted an altered photo showing an arrested Minnesota protester crying. What’s the story behind that?

REPORTER: It's a concerning development. The New York Times ran the image through an A.I. detection system and concluded that it showed signs of manipulation. The photo depicted Nekima Armstrong, a prominent activist, appearing to cry during her arrest. The revelation of its alteration has added another layer of controversy to the narrative surrounding the protests and official responses.

HOST: That certainly complicates the public's understanding of the events. And it ties into a broader national conversation about immigration policy, doesn't it? The Trump administration’s anti-immigrant crackdown has been a recurring theme.

REPORTER: Absolutely. This goes back to the staggering scale of the administration's efforts. Immigration reporter Caitlin Dickerson has been explaining the intricate pieces of what she describes as Trump's "deportation machine." These policies have wide-ranging impacts, from border enforcement to internal deportations, affecting communities across the country, as we are seeing in Minnesota.

HOST: From domestic policy to international business, we're seeing major shifts in the tech world. One of the biggest stories of the week has been the TikTok deal. What are the key takeaways from this high-profile acquisition?

REPORTER: This is a multifaceted story, involving several major players. The core of it is that several big companies and investment firms are now part of the new American TikTok. Many of these entities have ties to one another and, notably, to President Trump. Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake are among the key investors involved in securing the platform’s future in the U.S.

HOST: So, it's a consortium of powerful entities. And this deal comes after TikTok had already been performing strongly in the U.S. market, despite geopolitical pressures.

REPORTER: That's right. Even before this joint venture was finalized, TikTok and other China-linked apps actually dominated U.S. app downloads in 2025. They defied mounting political pressure, trade restrictions, and national security scrutiny, showcasing their immense popularity and market penetration. The deal now formally addresses the concerns that led to the potential ban.

HOST: And for the 200 million Americans who use TikTok, what does this new corporate structure mean for them? Will they need to download a new app, or will there be other changes to their user experience?

REPORTER: That's a big question many users have. The new corporate structure in the United States could indeed result in some changes. While details are still emerging, the expectation is that the core app functionality and content algorithm will remain largely the same, at least initially. However, the new ownership may eventually lead to shifts in content moderation, data handling, or even features, but a brand new app download is not currently anticipated.

HOST: This deal definitely sends a message to other Chinese tech companies with global ambitions. Is this a new reality they'll have to contend with?

REPORTER: Without a doubt. This deal represents a significant challenge for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and sets a precedent for other Chinese tech firms eyeing international markets. They must now contend with a complex landscape of geopolitical tensions and mistrust to do business in the United States. In fact, some are already choosing to avoid the U.S. market altogether, seeking growth opportunities elsewhere. It signals a potential realignment of global tech strategies.

HOST: Moving from tech to traditional finance, we have a significant acquisition to report. Capital One is making headlines with its latest deal.

REPORTER: That's correct. Capital One is buying the startup Brex for $5.15 billion. This acquisition marks the latest strategic move under Rich Fairbank, who is a rare founder-CEO of a major U.S. bank. This follows Capital One's earlier acquisition of Discover Financial, signaling a period of aggressive expansion for the credit card giant.

HOST: And staying in the financial sector, President Trump has made a bold move against one of Wall Street's biggest names.

REPORTER: Indeed. The president has launched a lawsuit against JPMorgan and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon. This legal effort has sent ripples through Corporate America, putting many on edge. The message behind Trump's lawsuit appears to be a broader challenge to established financial institutions and their leaders, potentially aiming to reshape relationships between the administration and major corporations.

HOST: From domestic business to international diplomacy, President Trump was also a central figure at the World Economic Forum in Davos. What were some of the key takeaways from his presence there?

REPORTER: Trump's visit to Davos was certainly eventful. He sharply criticized a number of current and former political leaders, using strong language. For instance, he took aim at French drug pricing, lambasted what he called "loser" windmills, and made pointed remarks about figures like Canada's Prime Minister and the former head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. It was a classic display of his direct and often confrontational style on the international stage.

HOST: He also held a charter-signing ceremony for a "new international oversight body," but I understand there were some notable absences.

REPORTER: That’s right. Before his departure from Davos, President Trump held a ceremony to sign a charter for his proposed "new international oversight body." However, several key allies were conspicuously absent from the event, which raised questions about the breadth of support for this initiative and its future efficacy. It underscores the challenges in forging broad international consensus.

HOST: And on the geopolitical front, there were high stakes but low expectations ahead of Ukraine talks involving Russia and the U.S. Was there any progress, particularly with President Trump pushing for a peace deal?

REPORTER: President Trump has indeed been pushing hard for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. However, the expectations for significant breakthroughs were low. Major issues between the two nations remain unresolved, and while the U.S. is involved in facilitating dialogue, the path to a comprehensive peace agreement appears challenging. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, also present at Davos, delivered a stark warning to Europe regarding the ongoing situation, highlighting the urgency and complexities.

HOST: Zelenskyy's warning resonates, especially considering other international reactions to U.S. policy. We've heard some poignant responses from Denmark, specifically from their veterans.

REPORTER: Yes, it's a somber note. Danish veterans have publicly expressed their pain, betrayal, and sadness regarding the rhetoric from the Trump administration. They describe feeling abandoned by an ally after having stood shoulder to shoulder with American soldiers in various conflicts. This sentiment highlights the significant impact of diplomatic language on long-standing alliances and military partnerships.

HOST: And while on the topic of international plans, the U.S. has unveiled some ambitious proposals for a "New Gaza." What does that entail?

REPORTER: The Trump administration has laid out its vision for post-war reconstruction in Gaza, unveiling plans for what they've termed a "New Gaza" featuring skyscrapers. President Trump stated, "We're going to be very successful in Gaza." This initiative aims to address the humanitarian and infrastructure needs of the region following recent conflicts, though details on its implementation and international cooperation are still being developed.

HOST: Back home, there's been another troubling revelation regarding data privacy, specifically involving the administration's internal systems.

REPORTER: That’s correct. New court documents have revealed even more ways that DOGE—an acronym that refers to a specific government data program—improperly accessed and shared sensitive personal data last year. The documents detail how this data appears to have been used to advance dubious fraud claims. This admission adds to growing concerns about government data handling and privacy protections.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive updates. A truly packed news cycle.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And before we sign off, here's a surprising fact to leave you with: Did you know that the total number of photos uploaded to Instagram every single day is equivalent to the number of photos taken during the entire 19th century? It's a stark illustration of our digital age's exponential data generation.

HOST: That's all for today's News Briefing. Thank you for joining us. We’ll be back tomorrow with more essential news and analysis. Until then, have a great day.
