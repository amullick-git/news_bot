HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing, your essential daily update on the biggest stories shaping our world. I’m Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi, bringing you the details behind the headlines.

HOST: On this day in history, January twenty-sixth, we mark a pivotal moment for one of the world's largest democracies. In 1950, India adopted its Constitution, officially becoming a sovereign republic, a day celebrated annually as Republic Day. We’ll have more on this year’s celebrations later in the show. Today, we’re covering major developments from BBC News, NDTV News, The New York Times, and others. We begin in the United States, where tensions continue to escalate in Minneapolis following a fatal shooting involving federal immigration officials.

REPORTER: That’s right. A U.S. citizen, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, was killed early Saturday morning during an encounter with immigration officials. Details are still emerging, but initial reports indicate a highly contentious situation. Federal agents claim they acted in self-defense, a narrative strongly contradicted by Pretti’s parents, who accuse the officials of "sickening lies.".

HOST: And the response from lawmakers has been swift and severe, hasn't it?

REPORTER: Absolutely. The incident has ignited a firestorm in Washington. Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, has openly accused the federal government of a "cover up," demanding full transparency. Her sentiments are echoed across the aisle, with Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, cautioning the White House against any attempts to "shut down an investigation." This bipartisan call for accountability underscores the gravity of the situation and the widespread demand for answers.

HOST: It sounds like the administration is facing intense pressure to control the narrative.

REPORTER: Indeed. Reports suggest the Trump administration moved very quickly to shape public perception around Pretti's killing. This rush to judgment occurred even as video evidence began to surface, appearing to contradict the government’s initial account of events. The focus seems to have been on establishing a specific narrative before all the facts were out.

HOST: And how has President Trump personally responded to these mounting demands for accountability?

REPORTER: The president has maintained a defiant stance. Even as Pretti’s death marked the second such incident involving federal agents in Minnesota this month, and calls for accountability intensified, President Trump has continued his pattern of blaming opponents. His response has been largely insulated from dissenting voices, reflecting a resistance to acknowledge any potential missteps by federal agents. This approach has only fueled further criticism and calls for independent oversight.

HOST: So, what's been the public's reaction on the ground?

REPORTER: Minneapolis has seen significant public outrage. Protests erupted near the scene where Alex Pretti was shot, with demonstrators chanting his name. The fact that he is the second person this month to be shot dead by federal agents in the city has amplified the protests, turning them into a broader demonstration against federal law enforcement tactics and demanding justice for the victims. The BBC has reported on these protests, showing the community's demand for answers and accountability.

HOST: A very serious and evolving situation there in Minneapolis. We'll continue to follow those developments closely. Now, let’s turn our attention to Asia, specifically to Myanmar, where a highly anticipated election has just concluded. What can you tell us about it?

REPORTER: The election in Myanmar has been widely criticized as a "sham." The party backed by the military generals appears set for a landslide victory. However, the integrity of the process has been severely compromised, with many political parties banned from participating. Furthermore, voting did not even take place in about half of the country, which is currently gripped by fear and ongoing civil war. The outcome, therefore, is largely predetermined and unlikely to reflect the true will of the people.

HOST: A concerning situation for democracy in Myanmar. Now, let’s pivot to India, where the nation is celebrating its 77th Republic Day. Arohi, you mentioned this earlier; give us the latest.

REPORTER: Republic Day 2026 celebrations are in full swing across India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his wishes, calling this grand national festival a "symbol of India's pride and glory." The main event, a spectacular parade, commenced at 10:30 AM IST on Kartavya Path in Delhi. This year’s parade is particularly notable as it marks 150 years of 'Vande Mataram' and showcases India's significant military might, with security personnel ensuring a smooth and grand display.

HOST: Beyond the celebrations, what other significant news is emerging from India?

REPORTER: We have a few key stories. On the economic front, India is reportedly moving to slash tariffs on imported cars from 110% down to 40% as part of a new trade deal with the European Union. This move is expected to significantly ease access to the Indian market for European automakers.

HOST: That's a substantial shift in trade policy. And on the awards front, there's news about the prestigious Padma Awards.

REPORTER: Yes, the Padma Awards, among India's highest civilian honors, were announced. An Indian-American doctor has been awarded the Padma Bhushan for his groundbreaking work in advancing cancer treatment. We also have inspiring stories of Padma Shri recipients: a tribal Tarpa player, Dhinda, who stated he "worshipped God through music" and whose performances have enthralled audiences across Maharashtra. And Hally War, a conservationist from Meghalaya, received the Padma Shri for her unassuming championing of sustainability, praised by Nirmala Sitharaman. Also, Shibu Soren, a prominent political figure, was among 13 people named for the Padma Bhushan, with his son, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, remarking that his father will forever remain a 'Bharat Ratna'.

HOST: Fascinating stories of recognition and achievement. And finally, any news from the education sector?

REPORTER: IIT Delhi is set to conduct an open house in Kota on January 31st. This event is specifically for JEE Advanced 2026 aspirants, providing them with crucial information and insights as they prepare for the competitive examinations.

HOST: Thank you, Arohi, for that comprehensive look at the news from around the world. And that brings us to the end of today's Quick News Briefing. Before we sign off, here's a quick, surprising fact: Did you know that the world's oldest continually published newspaper still in existence is from Sweden? It's called the "Post-och Inrikes Tidningar," founded in 1645. Though it now publishes solely online, it has a remarkable 379-year history!

HOST: That’s all for today. Thank you for joining us. I’m Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi.

HOST: We'll be back tomorrow with more essential news. Have a good evening.
