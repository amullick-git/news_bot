HOST: Good morning and welcome to News Briefing! I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi.

HOST: On this day in history, January 14th, in 1784, the United States Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris, officially ending the Revolutionary War and establishing the U.S. as an independent nation. A foundational moment for the country whose economy and politics we'll be discussing quite a bit today. We're bringing you the latest headlines from BBC News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, US Top News and Analysis, and many other trusted sources. Let's dive right into our top stories, Arohi, starting with a significant economic debate in the U.S. President Trump has been crediting his tariff policies for the nation's economic strength, but how are economists viewing this claim?

REPORTER: Well, Arjav, despite the President's assertion that tariffs, which he's affectionately termed 'Mister Tariff,' are responsible for the country's robust growth, many economists are largely disagreeing. The prevailing analysis suggests that the United States economy is expanding in spite of these tariffs, not necessarily because of them. They point to various other indicators and global economic trends that are contributing to the current strength, rather than crediting tariffs as the primary driver. It's a key point of contention as we look at economic policy going forward.

HOST: That's a crucial distinction. And speaking of economic policy, the administration is also taking steps regarding Venezuelan oil. What's the latest there, and who stands to benefit?

REPORTER: The administration's assertion of control over Venezuelan oil is expected to significantly benefit U.S. refiners. These are the companies that process crude oil into gasoline and diesel. Analysts predict they will see immediate profits, potentially more so than the businesses involved in pumping the oil out of the ground. This move could reshape parts of the energy landscape and supply chains within the country.

HOST: So, immediate gains for a specific sector. And on a more personal financial note for many Americans, what can we expect regarding tax refunds this year?

REPORTER: Good news for many taxpayers, Arjav. Bigger tax refunds could be on the horizon for 2026. This is largely attributed to changes enacted in President Trump's "big beautiful bill." These increased refunds are anticipated to provide a boost to consumer spending, potentially injecting more capital into the economy as households receive more disposable income. The overall impact on consumer behavior and the economy will be closely watched.

HOST: That sounds like a welcome development for households. And alongside this, there's been some movement on credit card regulations. Banks appear to be bracing for a fight.

REPORTER: Indeed. Banks are reportedly preparing extensive battle plans to safeguard their credit card businesses. This comes in response to President Trump's efforts to cap interest rates on credit cards. An executive at JPMorgan Chase stated that "everything's on the table," indicating the industry's determination to resist these potential caps. This could lead to a significant showdown between the financial sector and the administration over consumer lending practices, with far-reaching implications for both banks and cardholders.

HOST: A major battle brewing on the financial front. And this focus on affordability ties into the President's broader message on his national tour.

REPORTER: Exactly. President Trump is currently on a national tour, pitching affordability as a key solution to combat voter frustration. This strategy aims to directly address concerns over the rising cost of living and everyday expenses, positioning his economic policies as beneficial to the average American. It's a central theme in his current public appearances as he seeks to connect with voters on bread-and-butter issues.

HOST: That's the political angle, but what about the latest economic data? How is inflation looking, and what about retail sales?

REPORTER: Recent economic data offers a mixed but generally positive picture. Wholesale inflation came in softer than expected, indicating some easing on the producer side, which could eventually translate to lower consumer prices. Simultaneously, consumer retail sales moved higher in November, showing that consumers maintained a healthy buying pace leading into the holiday season. This suggests continued economic activity and consumer confidence despite ongoing concerns.

HOST: So, some good signs there. But is that reflected across the board when we look at the Consumer Price Index?

REPORTER: Not entirely uniformly, Arjav. The consumer price index was unchanged in December, which is positive as it indicates a halt in overall price increases. However, inflation rates for some consumer staples, specifically food and electricity, remain elevated. So, while the overall index held steady, households are still feeling the pinch in these essential spending categories, making it a nuanced situation for many consumers.

HOST: A mixed bag for everyday expenses. And on the corporate earnings front, how did Bank of America fare?

REPORTER: Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, topped estimates in its latest earnings report. This positive performance was attributed to better-than-expected net interest income, which is the profit banks make from lending, and robust equities trading. The bank has largely benefited from recent tailwinds in the industry, showing strong financial health and resilience in the current economic climate.

HOST: Good news for the banking sector. But the retail landscape is telling a different story, particularly in luxury. We're hearing about the bankruptcy of Saks.

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. Saks, one of America's biggest luxury department stores, has filed for bankruptcy. This development raises many questions about the financial crisis impacting the luxury retail sector, and indeed, the broader retail landscape. It's a significant indicator of changing consumer habits, increased online competition, and economic pressures, even at the high end of the market. This follows a broader trend we've seen with several other retail giants struggling in recent years.

HOST: A stark contrast in financial health there. From corporate earnings and retail struggles, let's turn our attention to some significant developments in U.S. politics and law enforcement, particularly concerning the FBI. Arohi, we have a very unusual situation unfolding in Minnesota regarding the inquiry into the killing of Renee Macklin Good by an ICE agent. What exactly is happening?

REPORTER: This is indeed highly unusual, Arjav. The FBI is solely leading the inquiry into the killing of Renee Macklin Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, notably without any assistance from Minnesota authorities. This exclusion is raising eyebrows among legal experts, who emphasize that joint investigations between federal and local agencies are the standard protocol, especially in cases involving local jurisdictions. The ongoing feud between the Trump administration and Minnesota is widely believed to be directly impacting this probe.

HOST: A solo federal inquiry is certainly a deviation from the norm. And this situation has led to some dramatic resignations within the legal community.

REPORTER: Precisely. We're seeing Minnesota federal prosecutors resign following pressure from the Department of Justice to investigate Renee Macklin Good's widow. This development further complicates an already sensitive case and highlights internal disagreements over the handling of the inquiry. The resignations underscore the depth of the tension and raise significant questions about the perceived politicization of the investigation and its impact on the independence of federal prosecutors.

HOST: That's a serious turn of events, raising questions about independence and due process. This all plays into a broader context of ICE crackdowns, which have, in turn, sparked resistance in several American cities.

REPORTER: Absolutely. In Minneapolis and other cities where federal agents have conducted immigration crackdowns, residents have started forming loose, decentralized networks. These groups are actively tracking ICE movements and organizing protests in response to the operations. It's a grassroots resistance movement emerging in direct response to the federal enforcement actions, demonstrating a strong community resolve against these crackdowns.

HOST: It sounds like a community mobilizing. And the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, has been quite vocal on this issue.

REPORTER: Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, has become a prominent figure in this resistance. He famously "cussed out" ICE, a move that has earned him new respect within his city and among activists, even while creating new foes for him in Washington. Frey has a history of clashing with his own party's activist wing, but his firm stance on ICE appears to have solidified his position with many constituents, despite the political fallout at a national level. He's no stranger to crisis management, and this is just the latest example of his leadership style.

HOST: So, a local politician navigating a complex federal-local dynamic. And switching gears slightly but staying on the topic of federal agents, we have a remarkable story about the FBI searching a journalist's home. Arohi, an FBI search of a journalist's home for classified documents is exceedingly rare. Can you tell us more about this?

REPORTER: This is a truly significant and concerning development, Arjav. The FBI has searched the home of a Washington Post journalist in connection with an investigation into classified document disclosures. What makes this so alarming is how exceedingly rare such an action is. Even in investigations concerning classified disclosures, federal agents rarely resort to searching a reporter's residence. This move raises serious questions about press freedom, the protection of journalistic sources, and the boundaries of government investigations into the media. It’s a situation that is drawing widespread scrutiny.

HOST: A very serious precedent indeed, one that will undoubtedly spark widespread debate and concern among press freedom advocates. Now, let's shift our focus to the global economic landscape and international relations. Arohi, the World Economic Forum has just released its latest report on global risks. What are the top concerns for businesses heading into the new year?

REPORTER: The World Economic Forum's report captures a significant shift in the global risk landscape, Arjav. For the next two years, geoeconomic confrontation has leaped to the top spot on the list of business worries. This reflects growing concerns over trade wars, sanctions, and economic disputes between major powers. Tariffs and the downside risks of Artificial Intelligence are also highlighted as principal global threats for businesses. It paints a picture of increasing volatility and strategic competition in the international economic arena.

HOST: Geoeconomic confrontation at the top, that's a powerful indicator of the current geopolitical climate. And this brings us directly to China, which has just announced a record trade surplus.

REPORTER: That's correct, and it's quite a staggering figure. China's annual trade surplus hit a record $1.2 trillion last year, marking a 20 percent increase from 2024. This happened even as exports to the U.S. reportedly declined by 20 percent. The December export growth sharply beat expectations, largely catapulting the annual surplus to this new high, demonstrating China's robust export engine despite trade tensions.

HOST: A massive surplus, even with declining exports to the U.S. What's driving this, and what does it tell us about China's economic strategy?

REPORTER: This record surplus is largely driven by Beijing's strategy of keeping its currency weak, which makes its exports cheaper, and a concerted push towards self-reliance, aiming to replace imports with domestic production. Essentially, China is flooding world markets with its exports while simultaneously reducing its reliance on foreign goods. This strategy allows them to accumulate significant trade surpluses despite tensions with key trading partners like the U.S., highlighting a strategic economic maneuver for greater autonomy and resilience.

HOST: So, a calculated move for economic independence. And how is this impacting other nations, particularly Canada?

REPORTER: Canada is certainly feeling the ripple effects. Mark Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, is currently heading to Beijing to discuss Canada-China relations. With the U.S. outlook darkening for Canadian goods due to ongoing trade tensions and tariffs, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is actively seeking new markets for Canadian exports and aiming to mend relations with China after years of deep acrimony between the two nations. It's a clear effort to diversify and secure vital economic partnerships amidst a challenging global trade environment.

HOST: A proactive diplomatic push from Canada. And finally, let's quickly touch on a couple of international stories that caught our eye, showcasing the diversity of global events. Starting with a tragic accident in Thailand.

REPORTER: A devastating crane collapse on a train in Thailand has created a grim scene. Jonathan Head, a BBC correspondent on site, described it as an enormous setback for Thailand's efforts to modernize its infrastructure. It's a tragic incident with significant implications for the country's development plans and a stark reminder of the challenges in large-scale construction projects.

HOST: A sobering report. And from tragic news to a unique cultural celebration in North Africa.

REPORTER: Indeed. In North Africa, the Amazigh people are ringing in their new year, which they celebrate as 2976. This calendar places them almost a thousand years ahead of much of the rest of the world, offering a fascinating glimpse into their rich cultural heritage and distinct chronological tradition. It's a vibrant celebration highlighting their unique identity and history.

HOST: A truly unique perspective on time and celebration. And finally, a brief historical note from Israel.

REPORTER: From Acre, Israel, our international team shared a postcard moment, highlighting an old fortress that vividly recalls the time of the Crusades. It's a powerful reminder of the deep historical layers present in many parts of the world, where ancient pasts continue to shape the modern landscape and offer windows into centuries of human history.

HOST: Thank you, Arohi, for that comprehensive look at the headlines, both big and small, domestic and international. That brings us to the end of our News Briefing for today. Before we go, here's a fun fact to leave you with. Did you know that the world's first successful vaccine was developed in 1796 for smallpox, using cowpox material? The word 'vaccine' itself comes from the Latin word 'vacca,' meaning 'cow.' A fascinating origin for a medical breakthrough that changed humanity. Thank you for joining us. We'll be back tomorrow with more essential news and analysis. Until then, have a great day.
