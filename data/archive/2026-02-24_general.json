Ran 53 models (leading open-source, open-weight, proprietary) with no system prompt, forced choice between drive and walk, with a reasoning field.<p>On a single run, only 11 out of 53 got it right (42 said walk). But a single run doesn't prove much, so I reran every model 10 times. Same prompt, no cache, clean slate.<p>The results got worse. Of the 11 that passed the single run, only 5 could do it consistently. GPT-5 managed 7/10. GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, every Llama and Mistral model scored 0/10 across all 10 runs.<p>People kept saying humans would fail this too, so I got a human baseline through Rapidata (10k people, same forced choice): 71.5% said drive. Most models perform below that.<p>All reasoning traces (ran via Opper, my startup), full model breakdown, human baseline data, and raw JSON files are in the writeup for anyone who wants to dig in or run their own analysis.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47128138\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47128138</a></p>\n<p>Points: 309</p>\n<p># Comments: 374</p>",

In particular, we\u2019re curious to hear the community\u2019s take on our inclusion of AI-related topics (e.g., dedicating an entire class to the topic of agentic coding; though we tried to counterbalance it with plenty of disclaimers, and a dedicated section on AI etiquette in Beyond the Code).<p>--Anish, Jon, and Jose</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47124171\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47124171</a></p>\n<p>Points: 166</p>\n<p># Comments: 48</p>",

    "title": "Show HN: Emdash \u2013 Open-source agentic development environment",
    "summary": "<p>Hey HN! We\u2019re Arne and Raban, the founders of Emdash (<a href=\"https://github.com/generalaction/emdash\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/generalaction/emdash</a>).<p>Emdash is an open-source and provider-agnostic desktop app that lets you run multiple coding agents in parallel, each isolated in its own git worktree, either locally or over SSH on a remote machine. We call it an Agentic Development Environment (ADE).<p>You can see a 1 minute demo here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X31nK-zlzKo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/X31nK-zlzKo</a><p>We are building Emdash for ourselves. While working on a cap-table management application (think Stripe Atlas + Pulley), we found our development workflow to be messy: lots of terminals, lots of branches, and too much time spent waiting on Codex.<p>Emdash puts the terminal at the center and makes it easy to run multiple agents at once. Each agent runs as a task in its own git worktree. You can start one or a few agents on the same problem, test, and review.<p>Emdash works over SSH so you can run agents where your code lives and keep the parallel workflow. You can assign tickets to agents, edit files manually, and review changes.<p>We also spent time making task startup fast. Each task can be created in a worktree, and creating worktrees on demand was taking 5s+ in some cases. We now keep a small reserve of worktrees in the background and let a new task claim one instantly. That brought task start time down to ~500\u20131000ms depending on the provider. We also spawn the shell directly and avoid loading the shell environments on startup.<p>We believe using the providers\u2019 native CLIs is the right approach. It gives you the full capabilities of each agent, always. If a provider starts supporting plan mode, we don't have to add that first.<p>We support 21 coding agent CLIs today, including Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Droid, Amp, Codebuff, and more. We auto-detect what you have installed and we\u2019re provider-agnostic by design. If there\u2019s a provider you want that we don\u2019t support yet, we can add it. We believe that in the future, some agents will be better suited for task X and others for task Y. Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini all have fans. We want to be agnostic and enable individuals and teams to freely switch between them.<p>Beyond orchestration, we try to pull most of the development loop into Emdash. You can review diffs, commit, open PRs, see CI/CD checks, and merge directly from Emdash once checks pass. When starting a task, you can pass issues from Linear, GitHub, and Jira to an agent. We also support convenience variables and lifecycle scripts so it\u2019s easy to allocate ports and test changes.<p>Emdash is fully open-source and MIT-licensed.<p>Download for macOS, Linux or Windows (as of yesterday !), or install via Homebrew: brew install --cask emdash.<p>We\u2019d love your feedback. How does your coding agent development setup look like, especially when working with multiple agents? We would want to learn more about it.
