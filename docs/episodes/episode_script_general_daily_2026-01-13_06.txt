HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing. I'm Arjav. On this day in 1968, Douglas Engelbart demonstrated the computer mouse and hypertext, a foundational moment for our digital age, fitting as we discuss AI. We're covering headlines, summaries, and analysis from BBC News, Hacker News, US Top News and Analysis, and more. Joining me is senior reporter, Arohi. Arohi, a packed agenda.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. Major developments from Washington to global markets, and significant tech shifts are making headlines today.

HOST: Let's jump right into some significant economic and political developments here in the US, specifically around the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. There’s been a bombshell announcement regarding Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. What can you tell us?

REPORTER: The 'Sell America' trade is a hot topic after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's bombshell announcement that he's under criminal investigation. This unprecedented development has sent ripples through the markets, causing the dollar to drop and gold to surge. It raises significant fears about the stability and integrity of the U.S. financial system, especially with pressure already mounting on the Fed.

HOST: And this isn't just a sudden development. This appears to be part of a broader, ongoing friction between the White House and the independent central bank, now reaching new intensity.

REPORTER: Exactly. This Justice Department probe of the Federal Reserve marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration's persistent effort to bend the independent central bank to the president's will. It’s a move that deeply challenges the Fed's autonomy, a critical aspect of its function in managing the nation's monetary policy and economic stability.

HOST: Clearly, the economy is a focal point for the administration. In related news, President Trump is heading to Detroit. What's the purpose of this visit?

REPORTER: President Trump is scheduled to give a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, with a clear aim to refocus the national conversation on the American economy. This trip follows a period where major foreign policy actions, particularly concerning Iran, have largely overshadowed domestic policy discussions, making this a strategic shift to economic themes.

HOST: From economic policy, let's turn to some other significant domestic stories, Arohi. We're seeing legal challenges against the administration, as well as major cases before the Supreme Court. What's happening on those fronts?

REPORTER: On the legal front, officials in Minnesota have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over alleged unconstitutional conduct by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. This highlights ongoing concerns regarding federal immigration enforcement practices and due process within states, intensifying the debate on federal-state powers.

HOST: And the Supreme Court also has some high-profile cases on its docket, particularly concerning transgender athletes.

REPORTER: That's right. The Supreme Court is currently hearing two pivotal cases on whether states can legally bar transgender athletes from women's sports. These cases address complex questions of gender identity, fairness, and biological differences in sports, with their outcomes set to have significant implications for transgender rights and athletic policies nationwide.

HOST: Moving now to international relations and the global energy market, Venezuela has been a consistent flashpoint. President Trump has shown a keen interest in Venezuela's oil reserves. What's the latest on his plans and the reality on the ground?

REPORTER: President Trump’s fixation on Venezuela’s oil raises the question of how much "energy dominance" is truly worth nowadays. While Venezuela possesses the world's largest proven oil reserves, accessing and utilizing them is severely hampered by years of political instability, underinvestment, and international sanctions. Significant production for global markets is still years off.

HOST: So, even with renewed interest, it's not an immediate windfall. Who stands to benefit, and who might lose out, if Venezuela's oil industry does eventually recover?

REPORTER: Companies that already have existing operations or established infrastructure in the country stand to benefit significantly from any recovery and stabilization. Conversely, those that have profited from the prolonged standoff between Caracas and Washington, perhaps through less transparent channels, could lose their advantageous positions as the country normalizes and open market practices potentially return.

HOST: And speaking of shifts, we've seen some remarkable movement in Venezuela's financial markets recently. What's driving that?

REPORTER: Venezuela's stock market has staged a dramatic rally, soaring by one hundred and thirty percent to record highs. This surge follows the recent capture of its ex-president, Nicolás Maduro. Investors are clearly interpreting this political development as a strong signal for potential economic turnaround and increased stability, fueling a renewed sense of optimism in the markets.

HOST: From Venezuela, let's shift our focus to Iran, where a severe crisis is unfolding. We've been receiving increasingly disturbing reports about widespread anti-government protests and a brutal crackdown by security forces. Arohi, what can you tell us about the situation on the ground?

REPORTER: The situation in Iran is grave and escalating rapidly. Eyewitnesses describe a deadly crackdown by security forces attacking anti-government protesters across numerous cities and regions. These widespread demonstrations represent the biggest challenge to Iran's rulers since the 1979 revolution, with serious concerns emerging about the scale of casualties, both injured and killed.

HOST: We've seen some graphic evidence emerging as well, despite attempts at an information blackout.

REPORTER: That's correct. Despite Iranian authorities imposing an information blackout and a near-total internet shutdown, eyewitness testimony and disturbing videos have managed to make their way out. BBC Verify has examined footage from a Tehran mortuary reportedly showing scores of bodies, providing stark and chilling evidence of the deadly toll.

HOST: So, a widespread crisis then. And how is the Trump administration responding to these developments in Iran?

REPORTER: President Trump has announced that any country doing business with Iran will now face a twenty-five percent U.S. tariff. This stern measure comes as the oil-rich country struggles to suppress the ongoing swell of massive anti-government protests, adding significant economic pressure to a regime already facing severe internal strife and existing international sanctions.

HOST: And what would be the practical implications of such a tariff? Which countries stand to be most affected by this economic declaration?

REPORTER: A twenty-five percent tariff on countries trading with Iran would have substantial global ramifications. Key trading partners, particularly in Asia and Europe, which still maintain significant economic ties, would be heavily impacted. This move aims to further isolate Iran economically and limit its capacity to fund the security crackdown, forcing nations to choose between Iranian trade and access to the US market.

HOST: Now, let's shift gears entirely to the world of technology, specifically the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence. It seems everyone is making moves, and big tech companies are forming surprising alliances. Arohi, starting with Apple, what's the latest in their AI strategy?

REPORTER: Apple, after facing increasing questions about its AI plans while competitors poured tens of billions into the technology, is now teaming up with Google for significant AI integration across its products. They've specifically picked Google's Gemini to run the AI-powered Siri expected to roll out later this year, a major strategic development for Apple's long-term AI strategy.

HOST: That's a huge development, and one that will undoubtedly reshape the consumer tech landscape. It also comes as other major tech players are aggressively integrating AI into their platforms. What else are we seeing in this fiercely competitive space?

REPORTER: We are seeing a rapid acceleration of AI integration across the board. Salesforce has just released an updated Slackbot, its personal assistant, now powered by Anthropic's AI model. This upgrade aims to significantly enhance productivity and user experience for millions of business users, highlighting the competitive push for AI dominance across various platforms.

HOST: And it's not just commercial applications. The Pentagon itself appears to be embracing some of these powerful AI chatbots, which is a development that's certainly grabbing international headlines. What's the story there?

REPORTER: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot will join Google's generative AI engine inside the Pentagon network. This is part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's vast and complex data as possible into developing AI technology, seen as crucial for enhancing capabilities, despite some global outcry and ethical questions.

HOST: So, a lot of closed systems and proprietary models dominating the field. Is there an alternative vision or a counter-movement emerging regarding how AI should be developed and deployed?

REPORTER: Absolutely. Mozilla, known for its commitment to an open internet, has articulated its open-source AI strategy, emphasizing "owners, not renters." Their approach aims to empower users and developers with greater control and transparency over AI models, moving away from centralized proprietary systems to foster broader innovation and address concerns about bias and accountability.

HOST: Arohi, thank you for that comprehensive overview. From US politics to global economics, and the relentless march of AI, it's clear we're living through an extraordinary time.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav. A period of rapid change on all fronts.

HOST: Before we sign off, here's a surprising tech fact: The first computer "bug" wasn't a software error, but an actual moth found trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947 by Grace Hopper. She famously taped it into her logbook, leading to the widespread use of the term "debugging" for fixing computer errors.

HOST: That wraps up today's News Briefing. Thank you for joining us. I'm Arjav, and we look forward to bringing you more essential updates next time. Have a great day!
