Generated pages are stored in the cloud and can be viewed from a gallery.<p>Now I Get It! uses the best LLMs out there, which means the app will improve as AI improves.<p>Free for now - it's capped at 20 articles per day so I don't burn cash.<p>A few things I (and maybe you will) find interesting:<p>* This is a pure convenience app. I could just as well use a saved prompt in Claude, but sometimes it's nice to have a niche-focused app. It's just cognitively easier, IMO.<p>* The app was built for myself and colleagues in various scientific fields. It can take an hour or more to read a detailed paper so this is like an on-ramp.<p>* The app is a place for me to experiment with using LLMs to translate scientific articles into software. The space is pregnant with possibilities.<p>* Everything in the app is the result of agentic engineering, e.g. plans, specs, tasks, execution loops.
