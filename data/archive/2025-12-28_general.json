    "summary": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m a new developer with Aphantasia (no mental imagery).<p>A side effect of this is that regaining focus after a distraction takes me a long time (the \"23-minute lag\"). I tried standard binaural beats, but I discovered a technical flaw: streaming compression (AAC/MP3 on Spotify/YouTube) often muddies the specific phase differences required for effective entrainment.<p>I realized that to get effective entrainment, I needed lossless audio. Since I couldn't stream lossless easily, I decided to generate it locally. I built Phantas \u2013 a browser engine that uses the Web Audio API to generate raw sine waves in real-time on the client side. This ensures mathematical precision with zero compression artifacts.<p>For audio it uses Native AudioContext for dual-oscillator generation (Left/Right channel split).<p>For visuals I pair the audio with a 490nm Cyan strobe. The hardest part was syncing the visual flash (using requestAnimationFrame) to the audio pulse without \"drift\" caused by JavaScript's event loop latency.<p>I built this primarily for myself. Subjectively, it has reduced my \"ramp-up\" time from ~20 minutes to about 5 minutes.<p>I\u2019m releasing the generator for free (no login) to see if this works for others or if it's just my specific brain chemistry. I\u2019d love feedback on:<p>- Audio/Visual Sync: Does the strobe feel tight on your specific browser/refresh rate?<p>- Intensity: Are the default 14Hz flickers too aggressive?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414258\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414258</a></p>\n<p>Points: 22</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>",
