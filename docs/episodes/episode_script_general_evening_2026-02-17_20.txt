HOST: Good Evening! Welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m Arjav, your host, and with me today, as always, is our brilliant reporter, Arohi, ready to dive into the latest headlines. On this day in history, back in 1959, the United States launched Vanguard 2, the world’s first weather satellite, marking a significant step in our ability to observe and understand Earth's climate. Today, we're tracking a world where technology and geopolitics continue to evolve at a breakneck pace. We'll be covering top stories from the New York Times, NPR, NDTV, CNBC, Fortune, Hacker News, and more. Arohi, let's start with some somber news from the civil rights front.

REPORTER: Absolutely. We begin with the passing of a towering figure in American history. Reverend Jesse Jackson, the longtime civil rights leader, died today at the age of 84. Jackson dedicated his life to advocating for racial equality and social justice, leaving an indelible mark on the nation’s political and social landscape. He was a pivotal voice for decades, continuing the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and inspiring millions.

HOST: A true legend. Moving from a look back at history to current events, high-stakes diplomatic talks are underway. What can you tell us about the negotiations concerning Iran’s nuclear program?

REPORTER: Today, the U.S. and Iran are indeed engaged in crucial negotiations in Geneva regarding Iran's nuclear program. These talks come amidst heightened tensions and international scrutiny. Diplomats are working to find common ground on critical issues, aiming to de-escalate the situation and ensure nuclear non-proliferation. The discussions involve complex details surrounding uranium enrichment and international inspections. Separately, from Geneva, officials confirmed that the Epstein emails have continued to reverberate across several industries, with new details emerging at the end of Tuesday.

HOST: And speaking of international relations and complex situations, former President Trump had a stated goal to end the war in Ukraine quickly. What's the latest on that front during his first year back in office?

REPORTER: The situation in Ukraine remains challenging. Russian attacks and Ukrainian civilian deaths have regrettably risen during President Trump's first year back in the White House, as his peace talks have continued to drag on. The conflict's complexities, including territorial disputes and security guarantees, have proven difficult to resolve, underscoring the deep-seated challenges in achieving a lasting peace.

HOST: A very fluid situation. Elsewhere on the global stage, we have a significant claim regarding China. What details have been released about an alleged secret nuclear test?

REPORTER: The U.S. has released new details regarding an alleged secret Chinese nuclear test. A U.S. official, speaking at an event in Washington D.C., stated that a remote earthquake detected in 2020 was, in fact, caused by a Chinese nuclear test. This claim, if substantiated, raises concerns about compliance with international nuclear testing moratoriums and transparency in global security.

HOST: That certainly adds to geopolitical complexities. On the economic side, we're seeing some positive news for U.S. investments from Japan.

REPORTER: Indeed. President Trump has hailed Japan’s first batch of U.S. investments, totaling $36 billion. These deals represent the initial phase of a larger $550 billion investment pledge. The aim is to secure tariff relief for Japan and reinforce the vital economic and strategic relationship between the two nations, highlighting a concerted effort to strengthen trade ties and stimulate economic growth.

HOST: Shifting our focus now to global order and the emerging technological landscape, particularly in Asia. India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has made some striking remarks about the changing world.

REPORTER: That's right. S. Jaishankar commented that the global order is changing and now headed towards a "long twilight zone." He emphasized that long-standing assumptions and expectations have become questionable, reflecting on the profound shifts in international power dynamics, economic systems, and diplomatic relations that are reshaping the world as we know it.

HOST: A powerful observation. And against this backdrop of a changing global order, India is making significant strides in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Tell us about the country's ambitions in AI.

REPORTER: India is indeed positioning itself as a major player in AI. The DRDO Chief, Chandrika Kaushik, has stated that AI is set to become the backbone of India's future warfare capabilities, highlighting its strategic importance for national security. Prime Minister Modi echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that India possesses the talent and entrepreneurial energy to become an "AI powerhouse," noting that startups and research institutions are being actively supported under the IndiaAI framework. This focus was prominently showcased at the NDTV AI Impact Summit 2026, which convened leaders to chart a framework for AI, featuring high-profile participants like Rishi Sunak and top OpenAI officials.

HOST: It sounds like India is all in on AI. How are international partnerships playing into this?

REPORTER: International collaborations are a key part of India's AI push. Just yesterday, on February 17th, France's President Macron and Prime Minister Modi held bilateral meetings in Mumbai, elevating their "Special Global Partnership" with a significant focus on defense, AI, and nuclear energy. Additionally, Nvidia is expanding its partnerships in India, including with venture capital firms, as it bets big on the country's AI ecosystem, which has already drawn substantial investments from other Big Tech companies.

HOST: A truly comprehensive strategy. Now, let's look at the broader AI industry and its impact on the market. Anthropic has released a new AI model, correct?

REPORTER: Yes, Anthropic has released Claude Sonnet 4.6, continuing its rapid pace of AI model development. The company stated that this new version offers more consistency with coding and is better at following complex coding instructions, marking another step in improving AI's utility for developers and businesses.

HOST: And despite these rapid advancements, there's an interesting paradox emerging concerning AI's impact on employment and productivity.

REPORTER: That's a fascinating point. A recent study revealed that thousands of CEOs have admitted AI has had no discernible impact on employment or productivity so far. This challenges some of the widespread expectations and anxieties surrounding AI integration, echoing the "productivity paradox" observed during earlier technological revolutions, where initial investment doesn't immediately translate to measurable gains.

HOST: Very interesting. Yet, despite that, major tech giants continue to pour billions into AI. What are Meta and Amazon doing?

REPORTER: Big Tech is certainly doubling down. Meta is significantly expanding its partnership with Nvidia in a deal likely worth tens of billions, focusing on deploying millions of GPUs and new standalone CPUs in its AI data centers. This underscores the massive infrastructure investment required for advanced AI. And speaking of significant investments, Amazon recently snapped a nine-day losing streak in which it lost over $450 billion in value. The company stated that it expects to spend $200 billion this year alone on AI initiatives, showcasing their deep commitment to leading in the AI race.

HOST: Incredible figures, highlighting the intense competition and future-facing investments in this space. Arohi, thank you for those insightful updates on a very busy news day.

REPORTER: My pleasure.

HOST: Before we sign off, here's a surprising fun fact about Artificial Intelligence. While the term 'Artificial Intelligence' was officially coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, the concept of intelligent machines dates back much further, with automatons and mechanical servants appearing in ancient Greek myths, demonstrating humanity's long-standing fascination with creating life-like intelligence. That's all for today's Quick News Briefing. We'll be back tomorrow with more. Until then, stay informed, and have a good evening!
