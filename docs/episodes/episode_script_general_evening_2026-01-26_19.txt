HOST: Good Evening! Welcome to Quick News Briefing, your essential daily update. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi. Today, January 26th, marks a significant day in history. On this day in 1926, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird gave the first public demonstration of television. A true technological breakthrough, paving the way for how we consume news and entertainment.

HOST: Absolutely fascinating. We're drawing our reports from trusted sources, including BBC News, The New York Times, ESPN Cricinfo.com for international cricket, US Top News and Analysis, and more. Arohi, let's start with a significant development in business and strategic resources: USA Rare Earth.

REPORTER: Arjav, a major move for USA Rare Earth. Their shares rallied after the Commerce Department took an equity stake. This capital infusion is pivotal, designed to help advance plans for a magnet manufacturing plant and develop a mine at the Round Top rare earth deposit in Texas, bolstering domestic supply chains.

HOST: So, direct government investment into a vital industry. What's the broader context, particularly given previous administrations?

REPORTER: This isn't the first government interest in rare earth. The Trump administration previously announced a 1.6 billion dollar deal with USA Rare Earth. Notably, the firm has business ties with Cantor Fitzgerald, run by the sons of President Trump’s former Commerce Secretary. This highlights a sustained focus on securing crucial domestic rare earth resources.

HOST: A clear focus on critical resources. Now, shifting dramatically, to highly contentious developments in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Arohi, what's been unfolding?

REPORTER: It's been a tense period, Arjav. The Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis intensified, leading to significant backlash. Federal agents, deployed to the city, were involved in the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens this month, escalating the situation.

HOST: Two fatal shootings, truly alarming. Details on those incidents and the immediate aftermath?

REPORTER: Yes, the situation reached a critical point with the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti and, separately, Renee Good, both by federal agents. Both incidents were caught on video, fueling public outrage. Federal judges are now considering the legality of the administration's actions amid multiple lawsuits and widespread protests.

HOST: How has the White House responded to this growing controversy and calls for accountability?

REPORTER: The White House's tone has shifted. Initially aggressive, as backlash grew, President Trump signaled changes to the immigration surge. The administration softened rhetoric regarding Alex Pretti’s killing, stating the President "does not want any Americans to lose their lives." This pivot comes as more Republicans express concern over these deadly encounters.

HOST: The situation has galvanized various sectors. Reaction from Minnesota’s local community and business leaders?

REPORTER: The community response is profound. Residents voiced deep fear, one Minnesotan telling the BBC "we're all terrified." Beyond protests, business leaders stepped in. CEOs from major Minnesota corporations, including UnitedHealth and Target, publicly called for "immediate de-escalation" of federal law enforcement, underscoring severe local impact.

HOST: Politically, how are Democrats responding, especially regarding broader legislative battles?

REPORTER: Democrats embrace a shutdown fight they previously avoided. Following the second fatal shooting in Minneapolis, they believe public opinion is on their side, willing to risk backlash to counter what they perceive as "police-state tactics." This puts immigration and federal enforcement squarely at the center of upcoming political clashes.

HOST: The situation is clearly multifaceted. How is the media, particularly The New York Times, investigating?

REPORTER: The New York Times undertook a significant investigation, utilizing over a dozen videos related to Alex Pretti’s shooting. Their goal: establish "ground truth"—understanding what happened, how, and who might be responsible. This journalistic effort aims to piece together a definitive narrative.

HOST: And finally, Arohi, how does Pennsylvania’s Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro weigh in?

REPORTER: Governor Shapiro has been vocal. In an NPR interview, he discussed immigration raids and the broader political landscape, particularly for the 2026 and 2028 elections. He shared insights from his memoir, "Where We Keep the Light," emphasizing finding light in constituents. His perspective offers how state leaders navigate national debates.

HOST: A complex, evolving situation in Minneapolis. Moving from political intensity, to a powerful force of nature gripping a huge swath of the U.S. Arohi, tell us about this winter storm.

REPORTER: It's been devastating, Arjav. A powerful winter storm walloped a significant U.S. portion, tragically claiming at least 25 lives. Hundreds of thousands are without power as freezing rain and heavy snow coated streets, halting travel and creating dangerous conditions. Widespread cold remains a major concern.

HOST: A stark reminder of winter's power. Amidst severe conditions, any lighter moments or unique stories from the storm?

REPORTER: Indeed. In New York City, despite challenges, some children found a silver lining. They skipped remote classes, embracing what they felt were more important: sledding and snowball fights in city parks, turning a disruptive weather event into an impromptu snow day.

HOST: Childhood magic amidst chaos. Finally, let's cap our briefing with a quick international cricket update.

REPORTER: Certainly, Arjav. In international cricket, England secured a Super Sixes victory, thanks to strong performances from bowlers and Rew. Sri Lanka has thrown their group wide open with a significant win. And for American cricket fans, the USA team also won their 16th Place Play-off against Scotland.

HOST: Excellent news for cricket fans. That brings us to the end of today's Quick News Briefing. Before we sign off, here's a surprising fact: Did you know the "Internet of Things" isn't new? The first true 'IoT' device was a Coca-Cola vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University in the early 1980s. Programmers could remotely check its status to see if it contained cold drinks before making the trek. A groundbreaking application of connected technology decades before "IoT" became mainstream!

HOST: Arohi, thank you for those insightful reports.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And thank you for joining us. We appreciate you tuning in. Until next time, stay informed and safe. Good evening!
