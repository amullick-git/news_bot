HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily dive into the stories shaping our world. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, bringing you the in-depth reports from across the globe.

HOST: Today is January 25th, 2026. On this day in history, back in 1984, Apple introduced its groundbreaking Macintosh computer to the world during Super Bowl XVIII, with that now-iconic "1984" commercial. A moment that truly revolutionized personal computing and set the stage for the digital age we live in. Today, we’re covering a wide range of headlines, from the lasting lessons of a space tragedy, to escalating tensions in the heartland of America, and significant developments from India. We’re drawing on comprehensive reports from NPR, The New York Times, NDTV News, CNBC, BBC, and other trusted sources to bring you the full picture.

REPORTER: It's certainly a packed agenda, and we have a lot to unpack for our listeners.

HOST: Let's start with a look back at a pivotal moment in space exploration, one that continues to resonate four decades later. Forty years ago, the space shuttle Challenger tragically broke apart just moments after liftoff, a disaster that shook the world. Arohi, NPR has delved into the lingering guilt and vital lessons from that day. What's the latest from their report?

REPORTER: That's right. Four decades on, the Challenger disaster remains a stark reminder of the complexities and risks of space travel. NPR's latest report takes a deep dive into the final, desperate efforts by engineers to halt that launch. These individuals, many of whom voiced serious concerns about the O-rings in the solid rocket boosters due to cold weather conditions, have carried the weight of that day with them for decades. Their warnings, tragically, went unheeded. The report highlights not only their enduring guilt but also the critical lessons that NASA continues to apply today regarding safety protocols, communication within the agency, and the importance of empowering engineers to speak up without fear of reprisal. The legacy of Challenger isn't just a tale of tragedy, but one of profound, ongoing learning that shapes every mission NASA undertakes now, emphasizing the human element in complex technological endeavors.

HOST: A powerful and somber reflection on a moment that changed NASA forever. Shifting gears now to some breaking news out of the U.S. that has captured national attention and ignited widespread protests. Tensions are incredibly high in Minneapolis following a fatal shooting involving federal agents. Arohi, what can you tell us about the situation?

REPORTER: This is a rapidly developing story with significant implications. Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by immigration officials during an encounter in Minneapolis on Saturday morning. The incident has fueled immense outrage and led to immediate protests.

HOST: And who was Alex Pretti? What do we know about him?

REPORTER: Pretti was an intensive care nurse at the VA hospital, described by his family and colleagues as someone who genuinely wanted to help others, a "force of good in the world." He was an avid outdoorsman, loved mountain biking, and was known for his compassionate nature. His parents have vociferously accused federal agents of "sickening lies," vehemently disputing the claim by Trump officials that agents shot in self-defense. They describe him as someone dedicated to his community and service.

HOST: So, this is not just an isolated incident, but part of a larger, escalating pattern?

REPORTER: Exactly. This is particularly concerning as Pretti's death marks the second time this month that federal agents have fatally shot someone in Minneapolis. Protesters quickly gathered near the scene, chanting Alex Pretti's name, expressing their anger and demanding accountability. The BBC captured some of those protests, showing the intensity of public sentiment. The repeated nature of these incidents has undeniably escalated tensions within the community and with federal agencies.

HOST: That escalation has clearly drawn a sharp reaction from Minnesota's leadership. Governor Walz has been quite outspoken, hasn't he?

REPORTER: He has. Governor Walz issued a fiery statement, directly calling on President Trump to immediately halt ICE operations in Minnesota. He stated, "Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota." His words underscore the profound disconnect and anger between state leadership and federal enforcement actions currently taking place. The Governor’s statement signals a deep concern over perceived overreach and a lack of proper training for the federal personnel operating in his state.

HOST: And this isn't just a local issue, is it? It's now impacting national politics and even the funding of government agencies.

REPORTER: That's correct, Arjav. The Minneapolis shooting has sent shockwaves directly to Capitol Hill, pushing Congress precariously close to a partial government shutdown over Department of Homeland Security funding. Senate Minority Leader Schumer has publicly stated he will vote against a package to fund DHS and a wide swath of the government. He explicitly linked his opposition to federal agents killing a U.S. citizen, making it clear that this incident is a critical factor in the ongoing budget negotiations. This dramatically raises the stakes, transforming a local tragedy into a national legislative crisis that could have far-reaching consequences for government services. The standoff highlights the deep partisan divisions and the immediate ramifications of such high-profile incidents.

HOST: This situation is certainly complex and deeply unsettling. Arohi, some commentators are even drawing stark comparisons between the violence seen in Minneapolis and conflicts abroad. What's being said on that front?

REPORTER: Indeed. A powerful opinion piece in The New York Times suggests that Minneapolis and Gaza now share a "violent language." The article posits that when federal agencies like ICE and militant groups like Hamas start to appear similar in the eyes of some observers, with masked agents and escalating force, it signals a deeply troubling societal breakdown. The piece argues that such a perception is dangerous for everyone, implying a erosion of trust in authority and a descent into a more chaotic and confrontational environment, both domestically and internationally. It's a provocative comparison designed to highlight the perceived intensity and gravity of the current situation in Minneapolis.

HOST: A truly sobering perspective on the far-reaching implications of the events unfolding in Minneapolis. We'll continue to monitor that story closely. Now, let's shift our focus to a different kind of significant national event. While parts of the country are grappling with political tensions, a massive winter storm is making its presence felt across a significant portion of the U.S. What are we seeing there?

REPORTER: We are indeed. A powerful winter storm system is currently sweeping across the United States, impacting roughly two-thirds of the country. Photos from NPR and other sources show widespread heavy snowfall, icy conditions, and strong winds. Many areas are experiencing significant travel disruptions, school closures, and hazardous driving conditions. Emergency services are advising residents to stay indoors and prepare for potential power outages. The sheer scale of this storm means millions are affected, from the West to the Midwest and into parts of the Northeast, with temperatures plummeting to dangerous lows. It's a serious weather event demanding caution from everyone in its path.

HOST: From the weather to the political landscape, let's move on to an interesting development in an early congressional race, where a powerful pro-Israel group is reportedly targeting a former ally. What's the story there?

REPORTER: In New Jersey, a significant political contest is brewing. A super PAC affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, commonly known as AIPAC, is actively running advertisements against Tom Malinowski. Malinowski is currently hoping to replace Governor Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey in the House of Representatives. What makes this particularly noteworthy is that Malinowski has previously been considered an ally to pro-Israel groups. This move signals a shift in strategy for AIPAC, demonstrating their willingness to target even former supporters if their policy positions diverge from the group's priorities, especially concerning issues related to Israel. It highlights the influence of such super PACs in shaping congressional races across the country.

HOST: An important dynamic to watch in the lead-up to the next elections. Staying with political figures, President Trump recently made some notable comments regarding UK soldiers and their role in Afghanistan. What did he say?

REPORTER: President Trump recently offered high praise for UK soldiers, describing them as "among the greatest of all warriors." This statement comes after previous contentious remarks where he had claimed that allied forces, including presumably the UK, had avoided the front lines during the Afghanistan conflict. This recent commendation appears to be a reversal or at least a significant softening of his earlier rhetoric, possibly aimed at mending diplomatic ties or acknowledging the sacrifices made by coalition forces. It demonstrates the often-unpredictable nature of presidential statements on international military contributions.

HOST: Interesting shift in tone there. Now, let's turn our attention to some major headlines coming out of India, where there's a mix of economic developments, social issues, and heartwarming stories. Arohi, let's start with the government's financial roadmap.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. The Modi government's Union Budgets have been a focal point, described by NDTV as a "Journey of Development, Welfare And Reforms." Over the years, these budgets have seen massive changes, often reflecting the government's push for economic growth, social welfare schemes, and structural reforms aimed at modernizing the Indian economy. They've focused on areas like infrastructure, digital transformation, and support for various sectors, consistently framing these initiatives as integral to India's progress.

HOST: And alongside these economic discussions, a prominent political voice is raising concerns about public health.

REPORTER: That's right. Rahul Gandhi, a key opposition figure, has continued to highlight the severe issue of air pollution in India. He urged immediate action, stating that citizens are "Paying With Health." Gandhi has been consistent in bringing this critical environmental and public health crisis to the forefront, calling for more robust government policies and interventions to tackle the alarming levels of pollution affecting millions across the country, particularly in major urban centers. His advocacy underscores the growing public demand for environmental accountability.

HOST: From policy and pollution to national recognition, the Padma Awards are always a significant event in India, honoring remarkable individuals. What's notable about this year's list?

REPORTER: The Padma Awards for 2026 were announced today, continuing the government's focus on celebrating "ordinary Indians with extraordinary contributions," often referred to as "unsung heroes." Sources indicate the list includes a 90-year-old musician and a Mumbai paediatrician, among others, recognized for their profound impact in their respective fields without necessarily being in the public spotlight. The full list, which covers various disciplines including arts, social work, public affairs, science, and medicine, aims to highlight diverse contributions that have enriched Indian society. It's an inspiring showcase of dedication and service.

HOST: Sounds like a diverse and deserving group of honorees. Shifting to a more local, yet intriguing, story, there was a unique controversy surrounding Republic Day in an Odisha district.

REPORTER: Indeed. Odisha's Koraput district found itself in the political limelight recently due to a significant row over a planned ban on non-vegetarian food on the occasion of the 77th Republic Day. The proposal sparked widespread debate and opposition, particularly from the district's large tribal population, for whom non-vegetarian food is a cultural staple. Ultimately, the ban did not work out, reflecting the complexities of imposing such restrictions in culturally diverse regions and the importance of respecting local customs and traditions. It was a clear example of how local issues can quickly escalate into broader cultural and political discussions.

HOST: And finally, a truly incredible story of dedication and love from Odisha, a testament to the human spirit.

REPORTER: This is one of those stories that truly touches the heart. Babu Lohar, a 75-year-old man from Odisha, undertook an astonishing 300-kilometer rickshaw odyssey to get his paralyzed wife, Jyoti, treated. Unable to afford an ambulance or other means of transport, Lohar simply started pedaling, pushing his wife for days across challenging terrain to reach a hospital where she could receive care. His remarkable journey has captivated the nation, highlighting both the immense love and perseverance of an individual, and simultaneously, the ongoing challenges faced by many in rural India in accessing adequate healthcare facilities. It's a powerful narrative of resilience against adversity.

HOST: An absolutely incredible display of love and determination. Arohi, thank you for those comprehensive reports, truly covering the spectrum of news from around the world.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And before we go, here's a surprising fun fact for our listeners: Did you know that the total weight of all the ants on Earth is estimated to be roughly equal to the total weight of all humans? It's a staggering thought about the sheer biomass of these tiny, industrious creatures.
