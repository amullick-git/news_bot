HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! Your daily dive into the headlines shaping our world. I'm Arjav.

REPORTER: And I'm Arohi, bringing you the most impactful stories from around the globe.

HOST: Arohi, before we jump into today's top stories, let's start with an "On This Day in History" fact. Twenty-seven years ago today, on January 4th, 1999, the Euro currency was officially introduced, marking a significant milestone in European economic integration. From economic shifts to geopolitical tremors, we cover it all. Today, we're particularly focused on breaking news concerning Venezuela, drawing insights from BBC News, NDTV News, The New York Times, and other key sources. Arohi, the major headline everyone is talking about revolves around Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Can you walk us through what's happened?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. It's been a truly extraordinary twenty-four hours. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is now in US custody in New York City, following his capture during US strikes on Saturday. Multiple sources, including BBC News, are showing video footage of his arrival in the US and journey into custody. This isn't just a simple arrest; it was a highly complex operation. Dubbed "Operation Absolute Resolve," elite US troops breached Maduro's heavily fortified compound in Caracas. Imagine a high-stakes, covert mission involving spies, drones, and even blowtorches to overcome defenses. Pictures and satellite images from Caracas to New York map out the audacious operation, showcasing the scale of this seizure. He is set to appear in US federal court on Monday, facing federal criminal charges.

HOST: That's an astonishing development. The capture of a sitting president by US forces is almost unprecedented. What has been the immediate reaction from the US administration, particularly from President Trump and other key figures?

REPORTER: The reaction from Washington has been swift and declarative. President Trump stated unequivocally that the US is "in charge" of Venezuela. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, has indicated that a military "quarantine" on some Venezuelan oil exports will remain in place, designed to maintain pressure on what the US considers Venezuela's acting leadership. Senator Marco Rubio has also been vocal, stressing the importance of coercing the country. These statements underscore a firm stance from the US, aiming to assert control and influence over Venezuela's future.

HOST: And how has the world, and indeed sections of the US political spectrum, reacted to this aggressive move?

REPORTER: The international community has responded with a mixed bag of reactions, Arjav. Many world leaders have expressed being "deeply shocked" by the large-scale US strike on Venezuela and Maduro's subsequent capture. Some have condemned it as a breach of international sovereignty. Here at home, while the move has drawn praise from some, especially Republican leaders, it also faces significant opposition. A partial list of US elected officials across the political spectrum has voiced strong objections to what they term Trump's "invasion" of Venezuela. Beyond the US, five major Left parties in India have issued a joint statement, strongly condemning what they describe as "US aggression" and calling for nationwide protests in solidarity with Venezuela. This action is also prompting a broader discussion about the US's long history of interventions in Latin America, with experts noting how this fits into a pattern dating back decades.

HOST: It certainly opens up a larger debate on international relations and sovereignty. And Venezuela's economy is so heavily reliant on oil. What does Maduro's arrest mean for the country's oil industry and global energy markets?

REPORTER: Maduro's arrest has indeed thrown Venezuela's politically fraught oil industries back into sharp focus. CNBC reports that control of these vast oil reserves is now a central question. President Trump has openly expressed a desire for more US oil companies to "go in" to Venezuela. However, that's far from straightforward. There are significant economic, historical, and even climate-related challenges that make any such move incredibly complex and potentially fraught with difficulties. The market is certainly watching closely to see who gains effective control and how production might be impacted.

HOST: From Venezuela to another unexpected international flashpoint, Arohi, we’re hearing about a surprising development concerning Greenland. What’s going on there?

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav, in a rather unexpected twist that highlights heightened geopolitical tensions, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has directly told the US to "stop the threats" regarding Greenland. This comes after the wife of Trump's deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, posted a photo that appeared to imply a US takeover of Greenland, just hours after the US attacks on Venezuela. Prime Minister Frederiksen was unequivocal, stating that the "US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom," which includes Greenland. This has certainly added another layer of diplomatic friction to an already volatile global landscape.

HOST: A very strong statement from Denmark there. Arohi, thank you for breaking down these complex stories for us.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And that brings us to the end of today's Quick News Briefing. Before we sign off, here's a quick fun fact. Did you know that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, often imagined as a solid island of floating trash, is actually a vast area primarily composed of dispersed microplastic particles, making it largely invisible to the naked eye and incredibly challenging to clean up? A surprising reality about a global environmental issue. Thank you for tuning in. Join us again tomorrow for more essential news updates. Good night!
