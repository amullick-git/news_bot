Box was a US Forest Ranger in Northern California, and I've got his daily work diary from 1927-1945, through the depression, WWII, Conservation Corps, and lots of forest fires. I've scanned the entire thing, had Claude help with transcription, indexing, and web site building, and put the whole thing here:<p><a href=\"https://forestrydiary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forestrydiary.com/</a><p>This is one of those projects I've sat on for years, but with Claude and Mistral helping with the handwriting recognition, and even helping me write a custom scanning app that would auto scan each page and put it into a database as I assembled everything.<p>As far as I know, this is the only US Forestry Diary that has been fully scanned in and published. I understand that there are other diaries in some collections, but none have been scanned in. I hope this helps somebody. Please let me know if it does.<p>This is the sort of project Claude and AI can help with - A personal project that sits on the shelf forever, but now a reasonable project that can be published in my spare time.

It is browser based camera toy where you \"rewire\" CCD pin pairs, turn knobs to get different glitch artefacts in real time to capture as photos. I had fun learning to simulate different pin modes - channel split, hue/phase shifts, horizontal clock delays, colour kill etc.<p>Here are some photos taken: <a href=\"https://glitchycam.com/gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://glitchycam.com/gallery</a><p>I intentionally leaned towards skeuomorphic design for nostalgia. I miss the days where I'd spend hours making a button to look like a physical button. Here I chose to make it look like a \"good enough\" Teenage Engineering device UI.<p>I tested/used GPT-5.3-Codex to build this from scratch, since there was a lot of hype around it on X. Maybe I wasn\u2019t using it right, but I found it needed a lot of code cleanup at every step and a lot of hand holding along the way. It missed details/nuances and didn't land the skeuomorphic buttons or the interaction polish. It mostly helped with boilerplate where there wasn't much thinking/detailing. It did give a basic starting point for the effect calculations, but didn't really move the needle on the details.<p>Please give it a go and let me know what you think - your photos and video never leave your browser (you can download them if you choose to).
