HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m Arjav, and joining me as always is our senior reporter, Arohi, bringing us the in-depth analysis of today's headlines. On this day in history, back in 1878, Thomas Edison received a patent for his phonograph, an invention that forever changed how we record and reproduce sound, laying groundwork for so much of the technology we see today.

Today, we're covering a wide range of critical developments, from a desperate search in Mexico to major shifts in US foreign policy and economic impacts at home, alongside India's growing prominence in the global AI landscape. We’ll be drawing from trusted sources including BBC News, NDTV News, US Top News and Analysis, and others, to bring you the most important stories shaping our world. Let's jump right in. Arohi, we've been following the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US presenter Savannah Guthrie. What's the latest in this evolving story?

REPORTER: Good evening, Arjav. The search for 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie has now entered its third week, with the focus of the desperate hunt for a breakthrough shifting to Mexico. Authorities are exploring all avenues, coordinating efforts across borders as concerns for her safety continue to mount. It's a challenging situation for her family and the authorities involved.

HOST: Absolutely, we hope for a swift resolution there. Moving now to international relations and a stark warning from the US. President Trump has issued a strong statement regarding Iran's nuclear program. Can you walk us through the implications?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. President Trump has stated the world has a mere ten days to see if Iran agrees to a deal, or, in his words, "bad things happen." This ultimatum comes as the US is surging forces to the Middle East amidst ongoing, delicate negotiations with the Islamic Republic over its nuclear capabilities. The stakes are incredibly high, with potential for significant regional and global instability.

HOST: Ten days is a very tight window. And speaking of President Trump, his administration also appears to be re-evaluating its stance on Russia, with suggestions of substantial deals on the table. What's the background here?

REPORTER: This marks a notable shift, Arjav. Since President Trump took office, the Kremlin has reportedly been dangling possible investments in front of him, playing into his famously transactional leadership style. It appears this message is beginning to resonate, particularly with certain investors who see tremendous deals at stake, potentially bringing Russia in from the cold economically.

HOST: So, economic incentives are driving some of these policy considerations. Staying with US domestic policy, the Supreme Court is poised to make a significant decision regarding the President’s tariff agenda. How could this impact everyday Americans?

REPORTER: This Supreme Court ruling carries immense implications for household finances. The decision will address a broad swath of President Trump's tariff policies, which have previously been aimed at various goods from international markets. A favorable ruling could solidify the administration's power to impose tariffs, potentially affecting consumer prices and the availability of imported goods across the country. Conversely, a negative ruling could unwind many of these measures.

HOST: Clear implications for pocketbooks across the nation. Yet, despite these tariffs, the US trade deficit figures for 2025 were recently released, and they tell an interesting story.

REPORTER: They do, Arjav. The US trade deficit for 2025 totaled a staggering $901 billion. What's particularly striking is that despite the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policies throughout the year, the imbalance was essentially unchanged. The deficit even swelled in December, highlighting the complex and persistent challenges in rebalancing global trade flows.

HOST: That's a significant figure that shows the difficulty of shifting deeply entrenched economic patterns. In parallel with these economic moves, President Trump also recently launched what he's calling his "Board of Peace." How does this fit into his broader vision?

REPORTER: The first gathering of President Trump’s alternative to the United Nations was certainly a manifestation of what he envisions as a "Trump World Order." He launched this new initiative with a golden gavel, and it’s being framed as a new forum for resolving global conflicts and promoting peace, but very much on his own terms. This signals a strategic divergence from traditional multilateral institutions.

HOST: An unconventional approach to global diplomacy. And still on the political front, we're seeing some domestic pushback on environmental policies and even calls for investigation into financial dealings. What's happening with the MAHA Moms movement and allegations surrounding a Trump family crypto venture?

REPORTER: On the environmental front, leaders of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA movement, which stands for "Mothers Against Harmful America," are infuriated. President Trump’s executive order aimed at spurring pesticide production has them turning against him, feeling they were lied to regarding environmental protections.

Meanwhile, House Democrats are calling for a Treasury probe into a Trump family crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. This scrutiny follows revelations that an Emirati royal, often referred to as the "Spy Sheikh," purchased a $500 million stake in the company last year. The inquiry focuses on potential conflicts of interest and regulatory oversight.

HOST: These are some serious allegations requiring close scrutiny. And we're also seeing reports of a "brain drain" impacting American science. What's behind this trend?

REPORTER: There's growing concern that the US is no longer attracting top scientific talent at the rate it once did, potentially leading to a "brain drain" that could significantly harm American scientific innovation. Reports suggest that factors like funding cuts and shifting immigration policies under the current administration are contributing to this decline, weakening the nation's standing in global scientific research.

HOST: A potential long-term impact on US competitiveness. Shifting gears slightly, an important case concerning press freedom is currently facing peril, with a surprising twist.

REPORTER: This is a remarkable development, Arjav. Alan Dershowitz, a lawyer who was actually present at the creation of the landmark New York Times v. Sullivan Supreme Court decision, is now asking the Supreme Court to either revise or destroy it. The case, which established a high bar for proving libel against public figures, is fundamental to press freedom in the US, making Dershowitz's current stance highly controversial and impactful.

HOST: That’s a truly fascinating turn of events for press freedom. Let's move across the globe now, where India is increasingly positioning itself as a central player in the global AI landscape. What's the latest from the AI Impact Summit?

REPORTER: India is definitely making its mark, Arjav. We've seen significant activity around AI, starting with Rishi Sunak's remarks that there's "no better place than India to discuss AI transformation," emphasizing that AI safety and progress go hand in hand. This sentiment was echoed at the recent AI Impact Summit.

HOST: And India isn't just hosting discussions; it's actively shaping policy.

REPORTER: Precisely. India, alongside Switzerland, is actively working to shape global AI rules. At the AI Impact Summit, Prime Minister Modi met with Swiss President Guy Parmelin, and economic cooperation, particularly in the tech sector, featured prominently in their talks, indicating a concerted effort to lead in AI governance.

HOST: That's a powerful statement on the international stage. And we've also seen India strengthening its ties with the UAE specifically around AI.

REPORTER: Absolutely. India-UAE ties are receiving a significant AI boost. The Abu Dhabi Crown Prince recently wrapped up a key visit to New Delhi, where Prime Minister Modi held bilateral discussions. These talks centered on enhancing cooperation in artificial intelligence, among other strategic sectors, further solidifying India's position as a regional AI hub.

HOST: All signs point to India becoming a major AI powerhouse. And Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, had some particularly strong words about India's future in this domain.

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. Sam Altman, a key figure in the AI world, predicted at the AI Impact Summit that "India will be OpenAI's biggest market soon." He described the pace of change in AI as nothing short of extraordinary, and his statement underscores the vast potential and rapid adoption of AI technologies within India's burgeoning digital economy.

HOST: That's a ringing endorsement and a clear signal of India's trajectory in AI. Thank you, Arohi, for that comprehensive look at today's top stories.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And before we go, here's a fun fact for you: while we've been talking about AI and technological breakthroughs, did you know that the first-ever webcam was invented at Cambridge University in 1991? Its sole purpose was to monitor a coffee pot, allowing researchers to check if there was fresh coffee without making a wasted trip to an empty one. Talk about practical innovation!

That's all for today's Quick News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. We hope you stay informed, stay engaged, and join us again next time for more essential updates. Good night.
