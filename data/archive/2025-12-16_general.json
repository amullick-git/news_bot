    "title": "Show HN: Zenflow \u2013 orchestrate coding agents without \"you're right\" loops",
    "summary": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m Andrew, Founder of Zencoder.<p>While building our IDE extensions and cloud agents, we ran into the same issue many of you likely face when using coding agents in complex repos: agents getting stuck in loops, apologizing, and wasting time.<p>We tried to manage this with scripts, but juggling terminal windows and copy-paste prompting was painful. So we built Zenflow, a free desktop tool to orchestrate AI coding workflows.<p>It handles the things we were missing in standard chat interfaces:<p>Cross-Model Verification: You can have Codex review Claude\u2019s code, or run them in parallel to see which model handles the specific context better.<p>Parallel Execution: Run five different approaches on a backlog item simultaneously\u2014mix \"Human-in-the-Loop\" for hard problems with \"YOLO\" runs for simple tasks.<p>Dynamic Workflows: Configured via simple .md files. Agents can actually \"rewire\" the next steps of the workflow dynamically based on the problem at hand.<p>Project list/kanban views across all workload<p>What we learned building this<p>To tune Zenflow, we ran 100+ experiments across public benchmarks (SWE-Bench-*, T-Bench) and private datasets. Two major takeaways that might interest this community:<p>Benchmark Saturation: Models are becoming progressively overtrained on all versions of SWE-Bench (even Pro). We found public results are diverging significantly from performance on private datasets. If you are building workflows, you can't rely on public benches.<p>The \"Goldilocks\" Workflow: In autonomous mode, heavy multi-step processes often multiply errors rather than fix them. Massive, complex prompt templates look good on paper but fail in practice. The most reliable setups landed in a narrow \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zone of just enough structure without over-orchestration.<p>The app is free to use and supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Zencoder.<p>We\u2019ve been dogfooding this heavily, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the default workflows and if they fit your mental model for agentic coding.<p>Download: <a href=\"https://zencoder.ai/zenflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://zencoder.ai/zenflow</a>\nYT flyby: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ai-klT-B8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Ai-klT-B8</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46290617\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46290617</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Hi HN,<p>Just wanted to share a tool i've been working on to help with my own study routine. It\u2019s a browser extension called Lingoku.<p>The idea is simple: we spend hours browsing the web in English every day. This tool replaces some of the english words with Japanese vocabulary based on your japanese level (Similar to Toucan, but with a better user experience).<p>It\u2019s basically an attempt to make the \"i+1\" method actually passive, you understand the sentence because it's mostly english, but you pick up Japanese words naturally from the context. It uses an LLM in the backend to make sure the translations fit the context (so it distinguishes between different meanings of the same word).<p>since it uses paid AI APIs for the words replacement, I couldn't make it 100% free (server costs are real, unfortunately). However, there is a \"forever free\" plan with daily credits that doesn't require a credit card. it should be enough for casual daily browsing.<p>I built this because I struggle with Anki burnout and wanted a way to review words without feeling like i am \"studying\"<p>It supports Chrome, Edge, and Firefox now. would love any feedback or feature requests!<p><a href=\"https://lingoku.ai/learn-japanese\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lingoku.ai/learn-japanese</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46296863\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46296863</a></p>\n<p>Points: 28</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>",
