HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m Arjav, ready to bring you up to speed on today's most significant headlines. Joining me, as always, is our brilliant reporter, Arohi, to delve into the details.

HOST: First, a quick look back On This Day in History: Did you know that it was on this very day, December 28th, in 1990, that the World Wide Web first became operational? A technological breakthrough that forever changed how we connect and share information globally.

HOST: Today, we’re covering a wide array of breaking news from around the globe, with reports from BBC News, NDTV News, NPR Topics, The New York Times, and other leading sources. Let’s jump right into the top stories. Arohi, a prominent journalist recently reflected on 2025, calling it a year unlike any other he’s witnessed. What did he mean by that?

REPORTER: That's right. Veteran BBC journalist John Simpson, who has reported on 40 wars, described 2025 as unparalleled in terms of major global conflicts. He noted the profound geopolitical implications of these ongoing struggles, highlighting a year marked by intense international upheaval and shifts.

HOST: A truly sobering observation. And speaking of global conflicts, there’s been a significant update regarding Ukraine and Russia. President Trump made some comments after meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. What can you tell us?

REPORTER: President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine and Russia are "closer than ever" to peace following his discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Florida resort. However, Trump also acknowledged that these talks could still break down, suggesting a fragile path forward despite the perceived progress.

HOST: "Closer than ever" is a hopeful phrase, but the acknowledgment of potential breakdown shows the delicate nature of these negotiations. This news comes with a poignant backdrop for Ukraine, given its history with nuclear disarmament. Many Ukrainians view a past decision as a mistake, don’t they?

REPORTER: Indeed. A nuclear missile museum in Ukraine serves as a bitter reminder for many citizens. It tells the story of how the country dismantled its nuclear weapons arsenal after gaining independence in 1991. Today, many Ukrainians believe that decision, made under the Budapest Memorandum, was a critical error, especially in light of current conflicts.

HOST: A stark reminder of historical decisions and their long-term impact. Shifting our focus to another geopolitical hotspot, China has announced military drills around Taiwan. What’s prompting this?

REPORTER: China is holding extensive military drills around Taiwan as a direct warning to what it calls "separatist forces." This move comes just days after the United States announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan, further escalating tensions in the region.

HOST: High stakes indeed. And in yet another move impacting international relations, President Trump also mentioned a U.S. strike in Venezuela. What details have been provided?

REPORTER: President Trump stated that the U.S. struck a "big facility" in Venezuela last week. He linked this action to ongoing U.S. efforts to disrupt drug trafficking from Latin America. However, the administration provided no further specific details about the nature or location of this alleged attack.

HOST: The lack of detail is notable. Moving from international conflicts to political landscapes, there are updates on elections in both Myanmar and Kosovo. What's the latest from Myanmar?

REPORTER: In Myanmar, polls have closed on the first day of what many observers are calling a "sham" election. Critics argue the vote, accompanied by a renewed crackdown on dissent, is primarily intended to entrench the ruling junta's power, rather than reflect genuine democratic will.

HOST: And what about the election results from Kosovo?

REPORTER: Kosovo’s ruling Vetevendosje party has secured a decisive victory in the recent election, ending months of political deadlock. This outcome means a third term in office for the party’s Albanian nationalist leader, Albin Kurti, consolidating his political position.

HOST: So, clear mandates in some regions, contested ones in others. Now, let’s turn our attention to some major natural and human-made events. The U.S. is bracing for a severe winter storm. What's the forecast?

REPORTER: A powerful "bomb cyclone" is intensifying across the U.S., bringing severe winter weather to millions. Forecasters predict heavy snow, blizzard conditions, and dangerous travel disruptions, with widespread power outages also expected as the storm progresses.

HOST: Sounds like a significant weather event for many. And a tragic incident to report from Mexico.

REPORTER: Sadly, a train crash in Mexico has killed 13 people and injured almost 100 others. The derailment occurred as the train rounded a bend near the town of Nizanda, and an investigation into the cause is now officially underway.

HOST: Our thoughts are with those affected by that tragedy. Shifting our focus to India, there’s been significant news regarding voter rolls in Uttar Pradesh. What’s happening there?

REPORTER: In Uttar Pradesh, nearly 2.89 crore names have been removed from the draft voter rolls. This extensive deletion from the pre-SIR voter list means the final draft, set to be published on December 31st, will have approximately 12.55 crore voters. The exercise aims to clean up the electoral database.

HOST: A massive undertaking to update the voter list. And still in India, a political row has erupted in Bengaluru regarding demolitions. What's the core of the debate?

REPORTER: A dispute has flared between the BJP and Congress over recent demolitions in Bengaluru. BJP leaders, including R Ashoka, questioned whether KC Venugopal is acting as a "Super Chief Minister," suggesting undue influence and criticizing the state government's actions.

HOST: Clearly, high political drama unfolding there. Another political skirmish is making headlines in Tamil Nadu.

REPORTER: That's right. Remarks by a Congress functionary about Tamil Nadu having higher debt than Uttar Pradesh have triggered a political controversy. This has put the ruling DMK-Congress alliance in an uncomfortable position as the 2026 Assembly elections approach.

HOST: Economic remarks igniting political tensions. And a lighter moment from the Congress party. What’s the story behind Rahul Gandhi and Digvijaya Singh’s interaction?

REPORTER: Rahul Gandhi had a "mischief" banter with former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh today at the party headquarters. This lighthearted exchange came just a day after Singh had publicly advised the Congress to learn from the RSS-BJP relationship, sparking some internal party discussion.

HOST: An interesting dynamic at play. Moving south, the winter session in Telangana is expected to be quite eventful. What's anticipated?

REPORTER: The Telangana Legislative Assembly’s winter session, starting tomorrow, is expected to be highly significant and potentially volatile. It marks the first major face-off between Chief Minister Revanth Reddy and former Chief Minister KCR since the Congress government took office, setting the stage for heated debates.

HOST: Certainly one to watch. And finally, some news involving the nation's highest office. President Droupadi Murmu recently undertook a unique sortie.

REPORTER: President Droupadi Murmu has undertaken a submarine sortie at the Karnataka Naval Base. This makes her only the second Indian president in history to experience a submarine journey, highlighting her engagement with the country's defense forces.

HOST: A remarkable and historic moment for the President. And that brings us to the end of today's Quick News Briefing.

HOST: Before we sign off, here's a fun fact for you: Did you know that the first computer mouse, invented by Douglas Engelbart in the 1960s, was actually made of wood? Talk about a technological evolution!

HOST: Thank you for tuning in. And a big thank you to Arohi for those insightful summaries. We appreciate you joining us. From Arjav and the entire team, have a great evening. We'll be back tomorrow with more essential news.
