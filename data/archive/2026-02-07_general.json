    "summary": "<p>Hello everyone!<p>I'm a solo developer who's been doing UI/UX work since 2007. Over the years, I watched design tools evolve from lightweight products into bloated feature-heavy platforms. I kept finding myself using a small amount of the features while the rest just mostly got in the way.<p>So a few years ago I set out to build a design tool just like I wanted. So I built Vecti with what I actually need: pixel-perfect grid snapping, a performant canvas renderer, shared asset libraries, and export/presentation features. No collaborative whiteboarding. No plugin ecosystem. No enterprise features. Just the design loop.<p>Four years later, I can proudly show it off. Built and hosted in the EU with European privacy regulations. Free tier available (no credit card, one editor forever).<p>On privacy: I use some basic analytics (page views, referrers) but zero tracking inside the app itself. No session recordings, no behavior analytics, no third-party scripts beyond the essentials.<p>If you're a solo designer or small team who wants a tool that stays out of your way, I'd genuinely appreciate your feedback:\n<a href=\"https://vecti.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://vecti.com</a><p>Happy to answer questions about the tech stack, architecture decisions, why certain features didn't make the cut, or what's next.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46917033\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46917033</a></p>\n<p>Points: 349</p>\n<p># Comments: 155</p>",
