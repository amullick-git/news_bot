As I locate more tools others may find useful I will refine and add them to the collection. Use them, Share them, or not. They will be here if you need them...<p>40+ dev tools (JSON formatters, regex tester, base64 encoder, Git command helper, etc.) that run entirely in your browser.\nZero tracking, zero analytics, zero data collection \u2013 everything processes locally.\nSelf-contained HTML files with no build process or frameworks.<p>I realized I had a lot of tools/utilities I've built over the years for my own use. I lothe having to 'sign-up' just to access/use simple utilities that I can create myself. I've refined them and put them in one safe place so I could easily access them if/when needed. I decided to make them available via Github Pages for anyone that may find them useful. Prism.Tools is the result.<p>Each tool is a standalone HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks, no npm packages, no build steps \u2013 just open the file and it works.<p>The entire toolset:<p>- 100% client-side processing \u2013 your data never leaves your browser.<p>- No external dependencies except for specific libraries from cdnjs.cloudflare.com (marked.js for markdown, exifr for image metadata, etc.)<p>- Consistent dark UI \u2013 every tool follows the same design language for familiarity.<p>- Vanilla JS where possible \u2013 only reaching for Public CDN Resources when necessary.<p>The constraint of \"single HTML file\" was intentional. It forces simplicity and ensures tools remain maintainable. It also means users can inspect, modify, or self-host any tool trivially.<p>These tools have helped me with debugging production issues, Quick formatting tasks, learning Git commands (the Git command helper has been particularly helpful)<p>Just visit <a href=\"https://blgardner.github.io/prism.tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blgardner.github.io/prism.tools/</a> and try any tool. No signup, no install.<p>What tools are missing that you find yourself needing?\nAny performance issues with specific tools?\nUI/UX friction points?<p>All tools follow the same privacy-first philosophy...\nYour data stays in your browser. No accounts, no tracking, no servers processing your information.\nThe project is also a demonstration that you don't always need React, Vue, or complex build pipelines \u2013 sometimes vanilla JavaScript in a single HTML file is exactly the right tool for the job.<p>Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)\nCSS3 with CSS Grid\nMinimal external libraries: marked.js, exifr, highlight.js, sql-formatter (all from CDN)\nNo frameworks, no bundlers, no npm\nHosted on Github Pages<p>Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation, design decisions, or specific tools!<p>All tools are inspectable \u2013 just view source on any page to see exactly how they work!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46511469\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46511469</a></p>\n<p>Points: 51</p>\n<p># Comments: 19</p>",
