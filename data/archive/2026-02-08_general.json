I wanted a way to instantly see which festivals had the highest 'match' density for my specific taste.<p>Why I built this:<p>I missed one of my favorite artists at a festival last year simply because I didn't recognize their name on a crowded poster. I realized that with Apple Music/Spotify APIs, this discovery process should be automated.<p>Key Features:<p>Library Matching:\nIt scans your library and ranks upcoming festivals by how many artists you actually follow.<p>Apple Sync: \nSeamlessly imports your top artists and creates custom schedules.<p>Offline-First:\nSince festival cell service is notoriously terrible, I focused on a robust local caching system so your schedule and maps work without a signal.<p>Technical Details:<p>Stack:\nReact Native, MongoDB, AWS.<p>Data:\nI built a custom aggregator that scrapes and normalizes lineup data from various sources to handle the 'entity resolution' problem (e.g., ensuring 'Artist A' is the same person across different posters).<p>Privacy:\nAll music library analysis is performed locally on-device where possible.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on the UI or any technical questions about the matching logic. I\u2019m also looking for feedback on how to improve the schedule-sharing feature for groups!<p>How do you find concerts/music festivals that match your taste?

    "summary": "<p>Hi HN, I'm a computer systems engineering student in Mexico who switched from film school. I built CineGraphs because my filmmaker friends and I kept hitting the same wall\u2014we'd have a vague idea for a film but no structured way to explore where it could go. Every AI writing tool we tried output generic, formulaic slop. I didn't want to build another ChatGPT wrapper, so I went a different route.<p>The idea is simple: you input a rough concept, and the tool generates branching narrative paths visualized as a graph. You can sculpt those branches into a structured screenplay format and export to Fountain for use in professional screenwriting software.<p>Most AI writing tools are trained on generic internet text, which is why they output generic results. I wanted something that understood actual cinematic storytelling\u2014not plot summaries or Wikipedia synopses, but the actual structural DNA of films. So I spent a month curating 100 films I consider high-quality cinema. Not just popular films, but works with distinctive narrative structures: Godard's jump cuts and essay-film digressions, Kurosawa's parallel character arcs, Brakhage's non-linear visual poetry, Tarkovsky's slow-burn temporal structures. The selection was deliberately eclectic because I wanted the model to learn that \"story\" can mean many things.<p>Getting useful training data from films is harder than it sounds. I built a 1000+ line Python pipeline using Qwen3-VL to analyze each film with subtitles enabled. The pipeline extracts scene-level narrative beats, character relationships and how they evolve, thematic threads, and dialogue patterns. The tricky part was getting Qwen3-VL to understand cinematic structure rather than just summarizing plot. I had to iterate on the prompts extensively to get it to identify things like \"this scene functions as a mirror to the opening\" or \"this character's arc inverts the protagonist's.\" That took weeks and I'm still not fully satisfied with it, but it's good enough to produce useful training data.<p>From those extractions I generated a 10K example dataset of prompt-to-branching-narrative pairs, then fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with a LoRA optimized for probabilistic story branching. The LoRA handles the graph generation\u2014exploring possible narrative directions\u2014while the full 7B model generates the actual technical screenplay format when you export. I chose the 7B model because I wanted something that could run affordably at scale while still being capable enough for nuanced generation. The whole thing is served on a single 4090 GPU using vLLM. The frontend uses React Flow for the graph visualization. The key insight was that screenwriting is fundamentally about making choices\u2014what if the character goes left instead of right?\u2014but most writing tools force you into a linear document too early. The graph structure lets you explore multiple paths before committing, which matches how writers actually think in early development.<p>The biggest surprise was how much the film selection mattered. Early versions trained on more mainstream films produced much more formulaic outputs. Adding experimental and international cinema dramatically improved the variety and interestingness of the generations. The model seemed to learn that narrative structure is a design space, not a formula.<p>We've been using it ourselves to break through second-act problems\u2014when you know where you want to end up but can't figure out how to get there. The branching format forces you to think in possibilities rather than committing too early.<p>You can try it at <a href=\"https://cinegraphs.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cinegraphs.ai/</a> \u2014 no signup required to test it out. You get a full project with up to 50 branches without registering, though you'll need to create an account to save it. Registered users get 3 free projects. I'd love feedback on whether the generation quality feels meaningfully different from generic AI tools, and whether the graph interface adds value or just friction.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46933515\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46933515</a></p>\n<p>Points: 46</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>",

    "summary": "<p>A month ago, I submitted my app \"DoNotNotify\" to control Android notifications on Show HN [0], and it trended on the front page for a day. I was happy, but the most upvoted comments on the thread were asking for the app to be open sourced, since it dealt with system-wide notifications. My promises weren't good enough, and the community wanted more!<p>Why didn't I open source it in the first place? Linux has been by primary driver for more than a decade. I genuinely believe in the philosophy, and have always wanted to give back to the community. The primary reason, probably, was because I was ashamed that I had 90% vibe-coded the app. More than 2 decades of writing software, and my first contribution to FOSS would be AI-generated code? Would it  withstand even the most minimal of scrutiny? Would by (unknown) name forever be tarnished? I exaggerate, but only slightly :)<p>So, yesterday, after a fair bit of trepidation, I changed the github repo visibility to public and put up a announcement on the app's website [1]. I have also submitted the app to F-Droid [2].
