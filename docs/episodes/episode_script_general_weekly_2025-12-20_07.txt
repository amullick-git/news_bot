HOST: Good Morning! Welcome to Weekly News Round-up! I'm Arjav, bringing you the top headlines from around the globe. And joining me today to break down the most important stories is our very insightful reporter, Arohi. Before we dive into today's news, let's take a quick look back. On this day in history, December 19th, in 1974, the Altair 8800 microcomputer was introduced. Many consider it the spark that ignited the personal computer revolution, a revolution that continues to shape our world, especially as we grapple with the latest advancements in artificial intelligence. Today, we're covering a wide array of topics, from the shifting landscape of US politics and the global economy to the rapidly evolving world of AI and its impact on everything from education to the job market. We've pulled our stories from diverse and trusted sources, including The New York Times, BBC News, NPR, CNBC, NDTV News, and the in-depth discussions found on Hacker News, ensuring you get a comprehensive picture of what’s happening. Arohi, it's great to have you with us. Let's jump right in with some fascinating developments out of Washington.

REPORTER: Thanks, Arjav. Happy to be here.

HOST: Arohi, the political scene always keeps us on our toes. Let's start with Secretary of State Rubio's marathon news conference. What did we learn from that extended engagement with the press?

REPORTER: Arjav, Secretary Rubio held a striking, lengthy news conference, notable not for major policy announcements, but for its tone. He engaged directly with reporters, took numerous questions, and showed a level of respect rarely seen from other Trump administration officials. This approach stands in contrast to the often combative media relations, suggesting a potential effort to calibrate or soften public communication as the administration looks ahead. It offered a different optic for the diplomatic arm of the government, perhaps a strategic recalibration.

HOST: That's a noteworthy change. And your reporting indicates that the jockeying for influence and succession within Trump’s "MAGA world" is already well underway, showing some emerging divides. What can you tell us?

REPORTER: That’s right, Arjav. Despite the next presidential election being some time away, significant internal frictions are developing within former President Trump's coalition. The BBC highlighted how these divides suggest an active jockeying for position among potential successors, stemming from differing visions for the party's future or personal ambitions. Understanding these internal dynamics is crucial, as they will undoubtedly shape the rhetoric and field leading into future primary contests, potentially affecting the unity of the movement itself.

HOST: So, the groundwork for future competition is being laid. Vice President JD Vance recently weighed in on the economy, striking a different tone. What was the substance of his message?

REPORTER: Vice President Vance delivered an economy speech that offered a distinct emphasis. While still highlighting administration successes, his message included a plea for Americans to "just hang in there a little longer," explicitly acknowledging current economic challenges. He projected future improvements, aiming to connect with those feeling the pinch and managing expectations, while affirming the administration's long-term strategy for economic uplift. This blend of reassurance and optimism marked a notable shift.

HOST: An interesting blend of optimism and perseverance. The broader economic picture under President Trump's trade policy was a defining feature of 2025. The New York Times presented 14 charts explaining the year. What were some key takeaways?

REPORTER: The New York Times provided a data-rich summary of 2025's economy, heavily influenced by President Trump’s trade policy, persistent inflation, and climbing stock prices. Charts illustrated the uneven impact of tariffs and disputes on various sectors, ongoing consumer price concerns, and the stock market's remarkable resilience despite broader uncertainties. It painted a complex picture where the effects of trade policy were felt unevenly, showcasing a year of significant shifts and some contradictory economic signals.

HOST: A complex economic picture, indeed. And for a lighter political note, NPR had its last news quiz of the year, which included some chatty White House insiders. What was that all about?

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav, NPR’s quiz playfully highlighted the ongoing fascination with internal White House dynamics. One category touched on "chatty White House insiders," referencing the persistent stream of information and occasional leaks that offer glimpses behind the scenes. This constant flow of, sometimes unauthorized, intelligence underscores how human elements within power structures lead to both strategic disclosures and unexpected revelations, a recurring theme in political reporting.

HOST: From internal political machinations, let's pivot to the broader economic outlook. The global economy is facing what’s been described as "a singularly turbulent time," with deeper uncertainty ahead. Arohi, what are the core drivers of this pervasive uncertainty?

REPORTER: Arjav, the New York Times highlights a fundamental reordering of global trade rules, layered on top of transformational changes in technology, demographics, and climate. These powerful forces are reshaping not just international commerce and supply chains, but also national job markets, political landscapes, and individual lives across continents. This widespread turbulence creates deep uncertainty for businesses and governments navigating an increasingly unpredictable global economic environment, demanding adaptive strategies.

HOST: That sounds like a monumental challenge. Within this global context, the domestic job market has some peculiar bright spots. Health care, for instance, is being called the "engine" of the job market, but that comes with its own risks. Can you elaborate?

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. While other sectors cool, health care is a significant driver of job growth, fueled by an aging population, ongoing medical advancements, and consistent demand for services. However, CNBC cautions that this heavy reliance poses a risk. Should the health care sector falter due to policy changes, unforeseen cost crises, or a major public health shift, its dominant role could trigger a severe ripple effect across the entire economy, highlighting a vulnerability in our current job market landscape.

HOST: A critical point about economic dependence. And despite that cooling job market and general gloom among consumers, holiday spending seems to be continuing strong. How do we reconcile this apparent contradiction between sentiment and spending?

REPORTER: It’s an interesting paradox, Arjav. Consumer sentiment is low due to inflation and job market shakiness, yet holiday shoppers are still spending robustly. CNBC explored this, suggesting consumers might prioritize experiences or gifts for loved ones, perhaps using accumulated savings or increasing reliance on credit. It’s a complex interplay where short-term desires and strategic spending navigate longer-term anxieties, maintaining retail sales despite a general feeling of economic gloom.

HOST: So, a mix of emotional spending and strategic shopping in challenging times. This brings us to a broader question: why do middle-class Americans feel that life is unaffordable, even when economists argue they are objectively richer than previous generations?

REPORTER: That's a crucial disconnect, Arjav. Economists use metrics like income growth and access to goods to show today's middle class is technically richer than in the 1960s. However, The New York Times reports that for Americans, especially younger generations, soaring costs for essentials like housing, education, and healthcare eclipse these gains. Stagnant wage growth relative to these core expenses makes achieving traditional middle-class milestones, like homeownership, feel increasingly out of reach, creating a pervasive feeling of unaffordability and financial precarity.

HOST: A compelling analysis of real-world pressures. Let's look at a bellwether for the industrial economy: FedEx. They recently reported earnings that beat expectations. What does their performance tell us about the state of global trade?

REPORTER: FedEx's strong earnings beat, as discussed by CEO Raj Subramaniam with CNBC, is a positive signal for the industrial economy, which he called its "heartbeat." This suggests that despite global uncertainties, there’s significant movement of goods and resilience in supply chains, indicating robust B2B activity, continued strength in e-commerce, or effective cost management by the company. It offers a tangible glimmer of optimism amidst an otherwise complex global trade picture, implying some sectors are performing better than expected.

HOST: That's reassuring news. However, another CNBC survey found that the high cost of goods is actively causing consumers to spend less for the holidays. How does this align with the earlier report about continued spending? Are consumers becoming more strategic?

REPORTER: It speaks to consumer nuance, Arjav. While overall spending remains robust, the CNBC All-America Economic Survey found high costs are influencing and people spend for holidays. Consumers are becoming more strategic, opting for fewer non-essential items, seeking out sales aggressively, or downscaling gift lists. This means strong aggregate retail numbers can mask the fact that many individuals are tightening their belts and adjusting budgets due to inflationary pressures, making every dollar count.

HOST: A clearer picture of consumer discernment. Now, on a somber note, we lost a significant voice in economic journalism this week. Robert Samuelson, the award-winning economics columnist, passed away at 79. What was his enduring legacy?

REPORTER: Robert Samuelson, who passed away at 79, was an award-winning economics columnist for Newsweek and The Washington Post for decades. His enduring legacy, as highlighted by The New York Times, was his remarkable ability to translate complex economic policy into reader-friendly vernacular. He demystified intricate topics, providing invaluable context and clarity for generations of readers on issues like fiscal policy, inflation, and unemployment, and his passing is a significant loss to the field of economic literacy.

HOST: A true master of clarity and insight. Shifting our focus to global markets, Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed this week as investors parsed delayed US jobs data. What were the key reactions and indicators we saw there?

REPORTER: Arjav, Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed, reacting to a decline on Wall Street and the delay of crucial U.S. jobs data for November. CNBC reported cautious trading as investors digested regional economic figures, like Japan's trade data, while awaiting clarity from the U.S. job market figures, which are a crucial indicator for global economic health and potential Federal Reserve policy actions. This underscores the interconnectedness and current wait-and-see attitude in global finance.

HOST: And staying in the region, Hong Kong's largest crypto exchange, HashKey, had its market debut this week. How did it fare?

REPORTER: HashKey, Hong Kong's largest licensed crypto exchange, had a rather lukewarm market debut, Arjav, with shares gaining only 3% after raising 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars. CNBC reported this modest performance reflects cautious sentiment in the crypto market. While a step towards greater regulatory legitimacy for digital assets in Hong Kong, broader market volatility, regulatory uncertainties in other jurisdictions, and cautious investor appetites likely tempered enthusiasm for its IPO.

HOST: A measured entry into a volatile space. And finally, Arohi, as the year winds down, what are the two big things investors are watching in the stock market this last full trading week?

REPORTER: As the last full trading week on Wall Street for 2025 approaches, CNBC highlights two key areas. First, investors are closely monitoring the final slate of economic reports, including updated inflation figures, manufacturing data, and consumer confidence indexes, to gauge the year-end economic health and inform 2026 outlooks and central bank policy expectations. Second, remaining corporate earnings reports from major companies could still spark significant market movements, offering last-minute insights into sector performance and corporate health.

HOST: From the intricacies of global markets, let's turn to the technology sector, specifically the rapidly accelerating field of Artificial Intelligence. Arohi, it seems like AI is everywhere, and discussions about its nuances are growing. What's the latest on the "ironies of automation"?

REPORTER: Arjav, indeed, AI's rapid integration is sparking deep reflection. A recent piece, "AI and the ironies of automation – Part 2," delves into the unexpected consequences of increasing automation. Often, instead of entirely replacing human tasks, AI shifts human effort to new areas – like managing the AI, interpreting its outputs, or handling edge cases it struggles with. It highlights that automation isn't always about eliminating work, but often about transforming it, creating new forms of complexity and human oversight demands, thereby changing, not just removing, human labor.

HOST: That's a fascinating perspective, suggesting AI changes the nature of work rather than just eliminating it. On a practical note, for programmers, how can AI be leveraged more effectively? Hacker News featured a discussion on this.

REPORTER: Yes, Hacker News hosted an "Ask HN" discussion on improving AI for programming. The core challenge highlighted was getting AI, like Claude Code, to produce code quality within 90% of what a human would write, efficiently. Users shared tips beyond simple prompting, focusing on providing highly structured input, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, AI-manageable steps, and leveraging AI for boilerplate generation and initial drafts. It’s about smart collaboration and rigorous human review, not full automation, to achieve desired code quality and speed.

HOST: So, it's about refining the interaction. And in India, Chief Justice Surya Kant weighed in on AI's role, stating that "Technology Should Amplify Human Judgment, Not Replace It." What's the significance of this legal perspective?

REPORTER: Chief Justice Surya Kant's statement, reported by NDTV, emphasizes a crucial ethical and practical principle for AI deployment, especially in critical sectors like the judiciary. He advocates for technology, including AI, to serve as a tool that enhances human capabilities and decision-making, rather than completely supplanting the essential human element of judgment. This perspective underscores the imperative for guardrails and robust human oversight in AI systems, ensuring they remain assistive rather than autonomous in sensitive, human-centric domains, as demonstrated during the COVID pandemic.

HOST: A vital ethical consideration from the judicial bench. Meanwhile, a poll reveals that psychologists are increasingly using AI tools, but also worrying about them. What are their main concerns?

REPORTER: Arjav, a new poll reveals 56% of psychologists are experimenting with AI tools, primarily for administrative tasks like note-taking and scheduling, which can boost efficiency. However, NPR reported that a majority also express significant concerns. These worries center on potential harms to patients, particularly regarding data privacy and the accuracy of AI in sensitive therapeutic contexts. There are also broader societal concerns about AI's impact on mental health and the maintenance of ethical boundaries, highlighting a cautious adoption within the profession.

HOST: A clear push-and-pull there. And in education, a related issue is emerging: teachers are using software to detect AI-generated student work, but what happens when these tools are wrong?

REPORTER: This is a growing problem, Arjav. School districts nationwide are investing thousands in AI detection software, despite research proving its unreliability. NPR highlights cases where students are falsely accused of using AI, leading to academic penalties and significant stress. These tools often produce false positives, misinterpreting original work as AI-generated, raising serious questions about academic integrity, fairness, and the immense pressure placed on students and educators by unproven technology. It's a critical ethical dilemma for the education system.

HOST: A real challenge for educators and students alike. It seems 2025 has been a year of significant reflection on AI. What were some key takeaways from a recent look back at the year in AI?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. "Reflections on AI at the End of 2025" from Antirez.com offered a broader perspective on the year's advancements and challenges. Key themes included the rapid deployment and capabilities of large language models, the ongoing debate around AI safety and ethics, and the increasing realization that AI is impacting nearly every industry, from healthcare to entertainment. The reflections underscored a year of both unprecedented innovation and growing calls for responsible development and deployment of these powerful, transformative technologies.

HOST: A pivotal year, undoubtedly. Looking ahead, Big Tech faces a key House vote on reforming the permit process for AI infrastructure. What's the "SPEED Act" and why is it considered crucial?

REPORTER: Arjav, Big Tech is intensely focused on the House vote regarding the "SPEED Act," a proposed reform for the permit process crucial for building AI infrastructure like data centers and advanced computing facilities. CNBC reports backers see this act as essential for the U.S. to maintain global leadership in AI against competitors like China, by removing bureaucratic hurdles. Expediting permits aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI capabilities, recognizing that physical infrastructure is a bottleneck for rapid technological advancement and innovation.

HOST: So, infrastructure is key to the AI race. And with the rise of AI, "prompt engineering" is becoming a critical skill. NDTV highlighted the "10 Latest Viral Artificial Intelligence Prompts 2026." What does this tell us?

REPORTER: It speaks to a new frontier in digital literacy, Arjav. NDTV's feature on "10 Latest Viral Artificial Intelligence Prompts 2026" underscores that crafting effective prompts for AI is emerging as a skill in its own right, distinct from traditional programming. As AI becomes more sophisticated and ubiquitous, the quality of its output is increasingly dependent on the precision, clarity, and ingenuity of the input. This means understanding how to communicate effectively with AI is now a valuable, and rapidly evolving, professional and creative asset for individuals and businesses alike.

HOST: An interesting new skill set. And on the research front, there's been an analysis of Anthropic’s interviews using structured LLM analysis. What insights did this yield?

REPORTER: Arjav, research detailed on Hacker News involved running Anthropic’s interviews through structured Large Language Model analysis, representing a novel application of AI in research itself. This approach aimed to glean deeper, more systematic insights from extensive qualitative data. By using LLMs to analyze interview responses, researchers sought to identify patterns, recurring themes, and nuanced perspectives on AI adoption and impacts across various contexts, providing a more efficient and potentially objective way to process large volumes of text-based information.

HOST: A new application of AI to understand itself, in a way. Turning to education again, how will AI-based learning tools change the way students learn by 2026?

REPORTER: NDTV projects that AI-based learning tools will dramatically transform student learning by 2026, Arjav. One of the biggest shifts will be in how students practice and revise lessons, moving beyond traditional methods. AI can provide highly personalized feedback, identify individual knowledge gaps, and adapt learning paths in real-time. This promises more efficient, customized, and engaging educational experiences, catering to individual student needs and learning styles, making learning truly adaptive.

HOST: Personalized learning accelerated. And in the competitive AI talent market, Google had a "boomerang year," hiring many ex-employees. What does this signify?

REPORTER: Arjav, CNBC reported that 20% of Google's AI software engineers hired in 2025 were "boomerang employees"—former staff returning to the company after gaining experience elsewhere. This signifies the intense competition for top AI talent in a rapidly expanding field. As the demand for skilled AI professionals heats up, companies like Google are increasingly turning to familiar faces, leveraging institutional knowledge and proven capabilities, highlighting the scarcity of expertise and the value of previous experience.

HOST: A clear sign of the high stakes in the AI talent war. A deeper philosophical question also emerged this week: why do AI chatbots use 'I'?

REPORTER: Arjav, The New York Times explored this fascinating question. AI chatbots are designed to behave in a humanlike way to make interactions more natural and relatable for users. However, some experts argue this is a terrible idea, fearing it anthropomorphizes the technology, blurs the lines between human and machine, and could lead users to falsely attribute consciousness, emotions, or genuine understanding to an algorithm. It's a complex debate about ethical design, user perception, and the responsible portrayal of AI capabilities.

HOST: A complex psychological and ethical debate. And finally, Arohi, Merriam-Webster just declared its word of the year, and it’s a direct nod to the growth of AI. What is it?

REPORTER: In a very telling move, Arjav, Merriam-Webster declared "slop" its word of the year, specifically referencing the rise of AI. CNBC reported that "slop" refers to the low-quality, often generic, uninspired, or derivative content increasingly churned out by artificial intelligence and proliferated across social media and other digital platforms. It reflects a growing public awareness and concern about the deluge of automated, less authentic content impacting our digital information landscape and cultural discourse.

HOST: And that brings us to the end of another packed week of news. Arohi, thank you so much for breaking down these important stories for us.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav. Always great to be here.

HOST: Before we sign off, here's a surprising fun fact for you: Did you know that the New York Stock Exchange, the largest in the world, was founded in 1792 by 24 stockbrokers and merchants, not in a grand hall, but under a buttonwood tree? It began as a simple agreement to trade securities on commission and has since grown into an economic powerhouse, a long way from its humble, natural origins. A fascinating tidbit as we reflect on global markets. That’s all for this week’s Weekly News Round-up. From Arohi and myself, Arjav, thank you for tuning in. We hope you stay informed and have a fantastic week ahead.
