HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily dive into the stories shaping our world. I’m Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi. Today, we're covering a spectrum of breaking news, from the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence and its profound impact on global economies and legal systems, to significant geopolitical developments, social media regulations, and heartfelt tributes.

HOST: Absolutely, Arohi. It’s an incredibly busy news day. On this day, February 17th, in 1948, the first electronic digital computer, the IBM SSEC, or Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator, was publicly unveiled. A true precursor to our digital age, it’s a powerful reminder of how far we’ve come, especially as we dive into today’s AI headlines. Today, we’re bringing you insights from BBC News, Hacker News, The New York Times, CNBC, NDTV, NPR, and many other trusted sources.

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. And leading our broadcast today is a significant cluster of stories from India, firmly placing the nation at the forefront of the global AI race.

HOST: That’s right. India is certainly making massive waves in the AI sector. We’ve seen major announcements and a high-profile summit drawing global attention. Can you walk us through the highlights?

REPORTER: Certainly. India is currently hosting the AI Impact Summit 2026, a five-day event at Bharat Mandapam, drawing over 250,000 attendees, including numerous overseas delegates. This summit is not just a platform for discussion; it's a clear statement of India’s strategic intent to decode and accelerate its AI growth. Key themes include applied AI and social equity, emphasizing both innovation and responsible deployment.

HOST: That’s an impressive scale. And the investment figures coming out of India are equally eye-catching.

REPORTER: They are. Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw revealed that India has seen over $200 billion in AI-related investment in just the last two years. This aggressive push is exemplified by a blockbuster announcement from the Adani Group, which plans to invest a staggering $100 billion in AI data centers over the next decade. This commitment underscores India's ambition to secure a stronger foothold in the global artificial intelligence race, recognizing that robust infrastructure is foundational to AI development.

HOST: One hundred billion dollars is a monumental investment. What does this mean for India's position on the world stage, especially with so many top global tech leaders attending the summit?

REPORTER: It signals a strong commitment, Arjav. The summit itself saw the presence of some of the biggest names in tech, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Their attendance highlights India’s significance as a key market, boasting a vast pool of young, tech-forward consumers and immense talent – factors crucial for the continued evolution and application of AI. This fusion of strategic investment, governmental support, and top-tier talent positions India as a crucial player, not just as a consumer, but as a developer and innovator in the AI landscape. The focus is clearly on practical implementation and ensuring AI benefits all segments of society, reflecting a holistic approach to technological advancement.

HOST: From national strategies to practical applications and indeed, some emerging challenges, AI is pervasive. Let's shift to how AI is impacting various other sectors. Arohi, there's a fascinating and somewhat concerning story about AI's use in legal proceedings.

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav, it's a cautionary tale straight from India’s highest court. The Supreme Court has flagged the perils of using Artificial Intelligence carelessly in drafting petitions, highlighting what they term the "Mercy vs Mankind" dilemma. This comes after high courts have also encountered challenges with submissions potentially generated or influenced by AI, raising questions about accuracy, authenticity, and the very foundation of legal arguments. It underscores the critical need for human oversight and ethical guidelines even in tasks that seem mundane.

HOST: That’s a powerful reminder of AI’s current limitations, particularly in fields requiring precision and nuanced human understanding. But on a more innovative front, we're seeing AI integrated into creative and design processes.

REPORTER: Absolutely. In a move that blends AI with design, Figma, the popular design software company, has partnered with Anthropic. The collaboration aims to transform AI-generated code directly into editable designs. This initiative could significantly streamline workflows for developers and designers, allowing for quicker iteration and bridging the gap between coding and visual creation. It’s a testament to how AI is being leveraged to enhance productivity and creativity, rather than simply replace it. This is a strategic move for Figma, especially given its recent experience caught in the software stock selloff that has impacted major names in the industry.

HOST: That’s a compelling development for the design and tech communities. And beyond direct creation, AI is also emerging as a new kind of influencer, impacting how brands connect with consumers.

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. It's a novel concept that brands are quickly grappling with: chatbots are the new influencers. Companies are realizing they can no longer simply promote themselves directly to potential customers. They now have to win over the algorithms and conversational AI interfaces, too. As more consumers turn to AI chatbots for recommendations, product information, and even purchasing decisions, these AI entities become critical gatekeepers. Brands must adapt their marketing strategies to ensure their products and services are favored, or at least accurately represented, by these digital concierges. It’s a seismic shift in the marketing landscape.

HOST: A fascinating pivot for brand strategy. And speaking of AI advancements, we're seeing continued innovation in that space, particularly from tech giants.

REPORTER: That's right. China's tech giant, Alibaba Group, has just unveiled its newest AI model series, Qwen3.5. What's particularly significant here is its focus on new "agentic capabilities." This move intensifies the competition in China's burgeoning AI space, where the race is shifting towards developing more autonomous and intelligent AI agents. These agents are designed to understand and execute complex tasks with minimal human intervention, signaling the next frontier in AI development beyond traditional chatbot functionalities.

HOST: From the technological forefront, let's shift our focus to the global stage, where regulatory bodies are increasingly scrutinizing social media giants. There’s a notable development out of Europe regarding major platforms.

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav. Spain has escalated the trans-Atlantic tech dispute by announcing plans for prosecutors to investigate X, Meta, and TikTok. This adds to the growing clash between the U.S. and Europe over regulating social media companies, particularly concerning content moderation, data privacy, and market dominance. European nations are increasingly assertive in enforcing their digital sovereignty, signaling a tougher regulatory environment for these tech behemoths.

HOST: This certainly reflects a broader global trend of increased government oversight on big tech. And amidst this, social media companies are also constantly looking for new revenue streams. Snap, for instance, is making a strategic move.

REPORTER: They are. Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, is entering the crowded market of creator subscriptions. The company aims to diversify its revenue streams by allowing creators to offer paid memberships, following in the footsteps of platforms like Patreon, Substack, and OnlyFans, while also competing with offerings from YouTube and Instagram. This move highlights the ongoing pivot towards a creator economy model, where direct monetization from fan communities becomes a crucial income source for both platforms and content producers. It’s a tough market to crack, but a necessary step for Snap to expand its financial resilience.

HOST: Now to some significant global headlines that have deeply resonated across the world. Arohi, we have news regarding the passing of a true icon.

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav, with heavy hearts, we report the passing of Reverend Jesse Jackson. The longtime civil rights leader, minister, and two-time presidential candidate died at the age of 84. Reverend Jackson dedicated his life to fighting for racial and economic justice, becoming a pivotal figure in the American civil rights movement. His impact extended globally, engaging in diplomacy and advocating for human rights worldwide. His legacy of activism, his charismatic presence, and his unwavering commitment to equality will be remembered for generations.

HOST: A profound loss for the nation and indeed, the world. Alongside that, we’re seeing continued fallout from another major story that has gripped public attention.

REPORTER: That’s right. The fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein files continues to expand, revealing more details and implications from the unsealed documents. This ongoing development continues to shed light on a dark chapter, with legal and social repercussions rippling through various circles. Additionally, on the international front, the U.S. and Iran are reportedly set for high-stakes nuclear talks today in Geneva, aiming to navigate the complexities surrounding Iran’s nuclear program amidst heightened regional tensions. These are critical negotiations that could have far-reaching impacts on global stability.

HOST: From geopolitics to consumer health, we also have an important development regarding a widely consumed product.

REPORTER: Yes, Arjav. A significant health crisis has reached a flashpoint in Europe, with French prosecutors announcing they have opened investigations into five companies involved in making baby formula. The probe concerns allegations of contaminated baby formula, specifically mentioning major brands like Nestle and Danone, among others. This investigation comes amidst growing concerns over the safety and quality of these products, which are vital for infant nutrition. It underscores the stringent regulatory requirements and the absolute necessity for product safety in this highly sensitive market, promising thorough scrutiny and potential widespread implications for the involved companies.

HOST: That’s certainly a critical story for parents and consumers globally. Shifting gears to a story that highlights a different, more heroic side of technology and human ingenuity.

REPORTER: This is a truly remarkable and heartwarming story, Arjav. A dark web agent, operating within the often-nefarious corners of the internet, managed to spot a crucial clue – a detail on a bedroom wall – that led to the rescue of a young girl from abuse. This agent, working tirelessly to combat online exploitation, utilized keen observation and technological savvy to piece together information from seemingly innocuous background details in images. It’s a powerful testament to the fact that even in the darkest digital spaces, there are individuals dedicated to fighting for justice and protecting the most vulnerable. It underscores the potential for good that can emerge from unexpected places, demonstrating how sharp human intellect combined with digital tools can achieve extraordinary outcomes.

HOST: What an incredible story, reminding us that technology, even in its most shadowy forms, can be leveraged for profound good by dedicated individuals. And finally, let’s end on a celebratory note, Arohi.

REPORTER: A wonderful transition, Arjav. Millions of people around the world are currently celebrating the start of the Lunar New Year 2026. Festivities are vibrant and diverse, taking place in communities from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires, and everywhere in between. This auspicious occasion marks a time for family reunions, traditional feasts, vibrant parades, and hopes for good fortune and prosperity in the coming year. It’s a beautiful demonstration of cultural heritage and global community spirit, bringing together people from various backgrounds to partake in shared joy and anticipation for a new beginning. The global scale of these celebrations truly underscores the rich tapestry of human cultures.

HOST: And with that festive note, we come to the end of our News Briefing for today. Before we go, here’s a fun fact: The world’s first recorded use of the term "robot" was in a 1920 Czech play, "R.U.R." or "Rossum's Universal Robots," where it described artificial laborers – a concept that directly influenced our modern understanding of automation and artificial intelligence, long before it became a reality.

REPORTER: Thank you for joining us.
