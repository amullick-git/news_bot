HOST: Good Morning! And welcome to News Briefing, your daily dive into the stories shaping our world. I’m Arjav.

REPORTER: And I’m Arohi. We’re here to bring you the latest developments from across the globe, cutting through the noise to deliver concise, impactful news.

HOST: Absolutely, Arohi. Before we jump into today’s headlines, let’s mark an important moment in history. On this day, February 15th, in 1946, ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania. This marked a monumental leap in computational power, a field that, as we’ll discuss today, continues to redefine our world, particularly with the advancements in artificial intelligence.

REPORTER: A fitting historical note for our tech-heavy segment later, Arjav.

HOST: Indeed. Today, we’re covering a broad spectrum of news from BBC News, Hacker News, NDTV News, The New York Times, and other leading sources. We have everything from international diplomacy and political maneuvering in Europe to a gripping abduction case in the US, global protests, and, of course, the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.

REPORTER: Let’s start with international relations, specifically the recent Munich Security Conference, where US-European ties were a major topic. Top Democrats were actively trying to reassure European leaders, signaling a potential shift in American foreign policy.

HOST: Right. We saw headlines like "Trump will be gone in three years": Top Democrats try to reassure Europe. What exactly was the sentiment there, Arohi?

REPORTER: Arjav, opposition politicians from the US flocked to Munich, using the summit as a platform to present an alternative vision to the "America First" policy. They aimed to reassure European allies that the current US administration's stance is temporary, with some even staking claims as future party leaders. The underlying message was a strong desire to reinforce transatlantic alliances, which have seen considerable strain recently.

HOST: And how did the current administration address these concerns? We also saw news about Secretary of State Rubio's comments.

REPORTER: That's right. Secretary of State Rubio, despite the ongoing tensions, reiterated that the US and Europe "belong together." He made an effort to reassure European leaders that the Trump administration still backs the transatlantic alliance, emphasizing shared values and strategic interests. This struck a notably softer tone compared to Vice President JD Vance’s remarks at last year's event.

HOST: So, a different approach this year. How were Rubio's words received by the European policymakers? Was it met with universal relief?

REPORTER: Not entirely, Arjav. While some European policymakers certainly welcomed Secretary Rubio's warm words as a positive step, others remained cautious. There’s a lingering sense of uncertainty, and they’re keen to see if these reassurances translate into concrete policy consistency. The memory of past tensions, particularly regarding trade and defense spending, still looms large for many.

HOST: It sounds like a complex diplomatic dance with a lot of underlying currents. Moving from the halls of power to global streets, we’re seeing significant protests related to Iran. What’s the latest on that front?

REPORTER: Global protests in solidarity with movements in Iran have swelled, with hundreds of thousands joining rallies around the world. Major cities like Munich, Los Angeles, and Toronto saw the largest crowds, demonstrating widespread international concern. Smaller but significant rallies also took place in Tel Aviv and Lisbon, highlighting the global reach of these demonstrations.

HOST: And amidst these widespread protests, there’s also movement on the diplomatic front regarding Iran’s nuclear program. What can you tell us about that?

REPORTER: Indeed, Arjav. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, recently told the BBC in Tehran that Iran is ready to discuss compromises to reach a nuclear deal. He stated that the ball was now "in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal." This suggests a potential opening for negotiations, despite the heightened tensions and global demonstrations. The Iranian government seems to be signaling a willingness to engage, albeit with conditions.

HOST: That’s a developing story we’ll certainly be following closely. Now, for a starkly different kind of international news, there's a troubling report from Ghana regarding a Russian national.

REPORTER: Yes, a Russian man, described as a 'pick-up artist,' is currently accused of secretly filming women in Ghana. Ghanaian authorities have called on Russia to extradite the man, who faces serious allegations of recording sexual encounters without consent. This incident has sparked outrage and raised questions about international legal cooperation in such cases.

HOST: A disturbing situation. Shifting back to the United States, a high-profile abduction case has captivated the nation. The story of Nancy Guthrie, mother of TV icon Savannah Guthrie, has gained national attention.

REPORTER: That’s right, Arjav. The abduction of Nancy Guthrie has certainly gripped the US, largely due to her daughter, Savannah Guthrie's, prominent role as a TV anchor. Her fame has undeniably amplified the case, turning it into a national obsession. Reports indicate a Bitcoin demand was made, adding another layer of complexity to an already high-stakes situation. The widespread media coverage has ensured that the public remains deeply invested in the outcome.

HOST: And speaking of high-profile cases with international connections, the fallout from the Epstein files continues to make waves, but with a noticeable difference between Europe and the US. What’s the contrast here?

REPORTER: This is a significant point, Arjav. The Epstein files fallout has led to the downfall of several elite figures in Europe. Officials with ties to Epstein have faced substantial public and professional consequences, with many losing their positions of power. However, the reckoning in the U.S. has been notably muted. A striking number of officials with similar connections in the United States have largely managed to hold onto their positions, prompting questions about accountability and transparency across different regions.

HOST: A stark difference in repercussions, Arohi. Now, let’s pivot to the world of technology, specifically Artificial Intelligence, which seems to be dominating headlines everywhere. We’re hearing about Meta's plans for facial recognition in its smart glasses. What's the latest on that?

REPORTER: Arjav, Meta is indeed planning to add facial recognition technology to its smart glasses. An internal memo from last year revealed the company believed the political tumult in the United States would distract critics from the feature’s eventual release. This move raises significant privacy concerns, as facial recognition technology in wearable devices has long been a contentious issue.

HOST: That's certainly a topic that will generate a lot of discussion. It seems like every tech company is now trying to position itself in the AI space. We’re seeing a trend where traditional software companies are rebranding themselves as AI innovators.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. The phrase "Software? No Way. We’re an A.I. Company Now!" really captures the current climate. As their stock valuations face pressure, many software makers are rapidly rebranding themselves to emphasize AI innovation. Sparkle emojis and AI-centric messaging are everywhere, though some of these efforts appear more successful and credible than others. It's a clear market signal that AI is where the investment and growth opportunities are perceived to be.

HOST: And this AI frenzy is definitely impacting the markets. We’re seeing headlines like "Markets brace for more AI noise and 'scare trading'." What should investors expect?

REPORTER: The global markets are certainly bracing for continued volatility driven by "AI noise" and "scare trading." Last week saw significant swings, and analysts are looking to those patterns for clues on the trading week ahead. The intense speculation, rapid technological announcements, and the sheer volume of AI-related news are contributing to an unpredictable environment, where investor sentiment can shift quickly based on the latest AI development or announcement.

HOST: It sounds like a wild ride for investors. Beyond the market hype, there are also serious ethical and practical concerns emerging with AI, particularly regarding its training data. We're seeing news publishers limiting access to the Internet Archive due to AI scraping concerns.

REPORTER: This is a critical development, Arjav. News publishers are increasingly concerned about AI models indiscriminately scraping their content from platforms like the Internet Archive for training data, often without permission or compensation. In response, many are now limiting access to their archives to mitigate this unauthorized use. This highlights the growing tension between AI developers' need for vast datasets and content creators' rights and economic sustainability.

HOST: And the impact of AI isn't just on text; it's profoundly changing how we interact with visual information. We're seeing how videos, now with AI, can both expose the truth and obscure it.

REPORTER: Precisely, Arjav. The article "More Than Ever, Videos Expose the Truth. And Cloud It, Too" really hits the nail on the head. For instance, in Minneapolis, videos related to the Alex Pretti killing effectively undermined the federal government’s initial account. They provided irrefutable evidence. However, the parallel rise of AI-generated videos, like the mentioned example of a deepfake Brad Pitt, demonstrates the grave dangers ahead. AI can now create highly realistic, fabricated videos, making it increasingly difficult to discern what’s real from what’s manipulated, posing immense challenges to trust and verification.

HOST: That’s a truly alarming prospect. Diving a bit deeper into the technical side of AI, there's discussion about "DjVu and its connection to Deep Learning" and also "Two different tricks for fast LLM inference." Can you quickly shed some light on these topics for our listeners?

REPORTER: Briefly, Arjav, DjVu is an older image compression technology, similar to PDF, but optimized for scanned documents. Its connection to Deep Learning lies in how modern AI techniques can improve or learn from such compression methods, especially for processing and understanding historical or large document archives. As for "Two different tricks for fast LLM inference," this refers to recent advancements in optimizing Large Language Models, or LLMs, to generate responses more quickly. These tricks involve clever computational techniques to reduce the processing time and memory required for the models to produce output, which is crucial for real-time AI applications.

HOST: Fascinating how the underlying tech continues to evolve. Now, let’s shift our focus to India, which is rapidly emerging as a significant player in the global AI landscape. We’re seeing a flurry of activity around the India AI Impact Summit and initiatives like YUVAi.

REPORTER: India is definitely making big strides, Arjav. The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is a major event, showcasing young AI innovators aged 13 to 21. It features challenges like YUVAi, a youth-focused AI initiative. The top 70 finalists from three AI challenges are set to showcase their innovations, with the top 20 finalists for YUVAi already announced. This summit is a testament to India's commitment to nurturing young talent in AI.

HOST: That’s an inspiring initiative. Beyond showcasing young talent, what broader programs is India implementing to push AI adoption and education?

REPORTER: The Centre is planning to scale up its "AI For All" program. India's top research institution, the Indian Council For Social Science Research, or ICSSR, will launch a nationwide campaign to promote Artificial Intelligence among young people in the country. This effort aims to democratize AI knowledge and skills, ensuring that a wider demographic can engage with this transformative technology.

HOST: And it seems like this push isn't going unnoticed by global leaders in the field. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has certainly weighed in on India's potential.

REPORTER: He has, Arjav. Sam Altman, ahead of the AI Impact Summit, stated that India "has the potential to lead in AI." He highlighted India’s rapid adoption, revealing that the country now boasts 100 million weekly active users of ChatGPT. This figure underscores the immense engagement and interest in AI within India, positioning it as a key player in the global AI revolution.

HOST: That's an incredible statistic and a powerful endorsement. For our listeners who might be interested in attending or learning more about these events, how can they get involved with the India AI Impact Summit?

REPORTER: For those interested in attending or learning more about the India AI Impact Summit 2026, details for registration are available online. The event is a prime opportunity to witness cutting-edge AI innovations and connect with the vibrant AI community in India. Specific registration links and information can be found on the NDTV education and India news sections online.

HOST: Arohi, that's a comprehensive look at an incredibly busy news cycle. Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

REPORTER: My pleasure, Arjav.

HOST: And before we wrap up today's News Briefing, here's a surprising fun fact for you: Did you know that the term 'robot' itself wasn't coined by a scientist, but by a playwright? Czech writer Karel Čapek introduced the word 'robot' in his 1920 play 'R.U.R.' or 'Rossum's Universal Robots.' He derived it from the Czech word 'robota,' meaning 'forced labor' or 'drudgery,' little anticipating the sophisticated AI we discuss today. A fascinating glimpse into the origins of a word that now defines a massive technological field.

HOST: That’s all for today’s News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. We’ll be back tomorrow with more headlines shaping our world. Until then, have a great day.
