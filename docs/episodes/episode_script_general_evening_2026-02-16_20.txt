HOST: Good Evening! And welcome to Quick News Briefing! I’m Arjav. On this day in history, February 16th, back in 1968, the United States saw a significant leap in public safety. The very first 911 emergency telephone system went into service in Haleyville, Alabama, forever changing how Americans access help in critical situations. Today, we’re covering headlines from BBC News, Cricket news from ESPN Cricinfo.com, NDTV News, NPR Topics, and other trusted sources around the globe. Joining me with the day’s top stories is Arohi.

REPORTER: Thanks, Arjav. We begin with a tragic incident in Rhode Island. Two people were killed in a shooting at a high school hockey game at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket. Authorities confirmed the shooter also died, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police have described this as a targeted event.

HOST: A truly heartbreaking story. And staying stateside, we have an update on the ongoing search for Nancy Guthrie, mother of a prominent "Today" show host.

REPORTER: That's right. The search for Nancy Guthrie has entered its third week, with investigators working through late-night bursts of activity, though visible results have been few. The sheriff stated Monday that her children and their spouses are not suspects. Adding to the developments, the FBI has recovered a DNA sample from a glove found in a field a few miles from Guthrie's home, analyzing it for leads. The family has made a new plea for her release.

HOST: We certainly hope for a breakthrough there. Moving now to Washington, D.C., and some significant political developments.

REPORTER: Indeed. Congress is currently on recess, but a partial shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security is now underway due to a lapse in funding. This situation highlights ongoing budgetary disagreements. And from domestic policy to international sports, we also have an interesting note about the Winter Olympics in Italy, where some superstar athletes have reportedly been experiencing the "yips." This phenomenon, where athletes suddenly lose their ability to perform routine movements under pressure, is an intriguing psychological challenge.

HOST: Fascinating. And on the topic of high-stakes situations, President Trump's approach to global security is drawing scrutiny.

REPORTER: Yes, concerns are being raised about President Trump's stance on rising nuclear danger, particularly as a key nuclear treaty recently expired. Critics argue his approach risks igniting a nuclear wildfire, highlighting the urgent need for a clear and stable strategy on this critical international issue.

HOST: A serious concern. We're also seeing unique stories unfold at the local level. Tell us about the situation in Coldwater, Kansas.

REPORTER: In Coldwater, Kansas, the Mexican-born mayor has been accused of voting illegally as a noncitizen. However, in a show of strong local support, many of his neighbors are pushing back, urging state and federal officials to drop the charges and back off, demonstrating the deep community ties and the mayor's standing among residents.

HOST: A compelling display of community solidarity. And shifting gears to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently returned from a trip to Germany. What were her reflections?

REPORTER: Following her attendance at the Munich Security Conference, AOC expressed frustrations in an interview. She argued that presidential speculation, alongside scrutiny of her slip-ups during the trip, overshadowed her intended anti-authoritarian message at the conference. It seems the political narrative surrounding her often takes precedence over the substance of her discussions.

HOST: An interesting point about political messaging. Now, let's turn our attention to international relations, specifically the strengthening ties between the US and India.

REPORTER: That's right, Arjav. US Ambassador Sergio Gor recently visited the Indian Army's Western Command headquarters in Chandimandir, Haryana's Panchkula. This visit, which also included Admiral Samuel J Paparo, underscores the continued growth and strengthening of Indo-US defense ties, signaling a deepening strategic partnership between the two nations.

HOST: A clear sign of ongoing collaboration. Moving to domestic news from India, we're seeing some political drama in Himachal Pradesh.

REPORTER: The Budget Session of the Himachal Pradesh Assembly began on a stormy note. Governor Shiv Pratap Shukla cut his assembly speech to a mere two minutes, sparking a row with the state government. The contention centers on the contentious issue of the Revenue Deficit Grant, or RDG, highlighting significant differences between the Governor and the state administration.

HOST: And a health update concerning a prominent Indian political figure?

REPORTER: Yes, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann was admitted to the hospital for observation and supportive care. No further details have been released about his condition, but we'll continue to monitor that developing story.

HOST: We wish him a speedy recovery. And unfortunately, another concerning report from Jammu and Kashmir.

REPORTER: Indeed. A disturbing video shows three individuals, including two Pakistani nationals, shooting their way out of a J&K observation home. This incident adds to a troubling history of jailbreak attempts by Pakistani nationals in the region, raising serious security questions.

HOST: A very serious breach. On a somber note, we also have news from Chhattisgarh.

REPORTER: In a tragic story from Chhattisgarh, a couple died by suicide after the death of their only son, Aditya Patel, who was 21, in a road accident back in 2024. The family shared, "He was our world," highlighting the profound grief that led to this devastating outcome.

HOST: A truly heartbreaking reminder of the fragility of life. Now, let's lighten the mood slightly and turn to the world of international cricket, with updates from the T20 World Cup.

REPORTER: Absolutely, Arjav. New Zealand is currently eyeing a Super Eight spot as they prepare to face Canada. Historically, these two teams have met just three times in international cricket, all during ODI World Cups. It promises to be an exciting match for New Zealand's campaign.

HOST: And some individual brilliance from Sri Lanka?

REPORTER: Yes, Sri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka delivered a spectacular performance, scoring his second T20I century. He hit a 52-ball 100 not out in the chase of 182, leading his team to victory. Nissanka later commented on his goal, stating he "had a big target to hit a 100 at this T20 World Cup," a goal he certainly achieved with flair.

HOST: What an outstanding achievement! And that brings us to the end of our news roundup for today. Before we go, here's a surprising fact for you: Did you know that the world's smallest computer is smaller than a grain of sand? Developed by IBM, these incredibly tiny computers are designed to monitor, analyze, communicate, and even act on data, pushing the boundaries of miniaturization in technology.

HOST: That's all for Quick News Briefing. Thank you for tuning in. From Arohi and myself, Arjav, have a good evening.
